0,Tunisia: Further Information: Ex-Minister Sentenced to Ten Years in Prison: Noureddine Bhiri,AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde30/8708/2024/en/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? On 18 October 2024, the Criminal Chamber of the Court of First Instance in Tunis sentenced Ennahdha leader and former justice minister Noureddine Bhiri to ten years in prison on the basis of a social media post attributed to him and which he denied writing. Noureddine Bhiri was accused of “trying to change the form of the government and inciting people against each other” under Article 72 of the Tunisian penal code. Noureddine Bhiri who has spent 18 months in arbitrary detention in the Mornaguia prison is being further punished simply for his peaceful political opposition. The Tunisian authorities must immediately release him and quash his conviction and sentence as his imprisonment is solely based on the peaceful exercise of his human rights.

0,USA: Alabama’s sixth execution of the year,AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/amr51/8710/2024/en/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? Alabama has scheduled Carey Grayson to be executed on 21 November 2024. In 1996, he became the last of four young males to be convicted of a 1994 murder. At the four separate trials, the prosecutor used mutually incompatible theories, claiming each defendant was the most culpable. In 2004, Alabama told the US Supreme Court that Carey Grayson was not the most culpable. His is the sole death sentence to survive on appeal. He was 19 at the time of the crime, emerging from a childhood marked by abuse, neglect and bipolar disorder. We urge the Governor to commute his sentence.

0,Why is the Democratic Republic of Congo wracked by conflict?,AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2024/10/why-is-the-democratic-republic-of-congo-wracked-by-conflict/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? The Democratic Republic of Congo’s (DRC) crisis stems from a series of post-colonial battles from power, which began after the country gained independence from Belgium in 1960. Decades of conflict have been fuelled by ethnic tensions, political rivalries, corruption and fighting for control of valuable natural resources.  DRC’s current conflict has been ongoing since the 1990s, particularly in the eastern part of the country which borders South Sudan, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and Tanzania. Inter-communal violence regularly breaks out in other regions, as it has been the case recently in central, southern and  western provinces of Kasaï, Tshopo, Mai-Ndombe, Kwilu and Kwango.  There are currently over a hundred active armed groups in the DRC. Many of them are local militias seeking to protect their communities after over three decades of unrest. Loyalties and rivalries between groups are constantly evolving and generally guided by ethnic identities, economic interests and political manipulation.  Poor governance, poor management of post-colonial nation/state building, conflict over land and other natural resources are some of the factors driving the conflict. There are also deep divisions between ethnic groups which are largely the product of the region’s colonial history and historical grievances from almost five decades of nearly continuous unrest.    The colonial legacy continues to affect ethnic tensions in the DRC. Like many African countries, its borders were drawn by European colonial powers, grouping diverse ethnic groups with little regard for historical rivalries. The colonial practice of divide and rule exacerbated these tensions as colonial authorities sought to maintain control over subjugated local populations.   The DRC is rich in natural resources, including coltan, gold, diamonds and cobalt. The exploitation of these minerals is a significant driver of prolonged conflicts between groups. Some armed groups are financed by their control over of these resources.  In 1965, Mobutu Sese Seko seized power in the Congo, that he later renamed Zaire, and went on to rule for another 32 years. His regime was marked by weak governance and high levels of corruption. After the Mobutu regime was overthrown in 1997, armed groups thrived amid local and regional struggles for influence as well as state’s failure to provide essential services and security to the population. The lack of economic opportunities and development pushed many people to join armed groups, further destabilizing the country.  Neighbouring countries, particularly Rwanda and Uganda, have played pivotal roles in the DRC’s conflicts – either backing armed groups or intervening militarily for political, economic, or security reasons. The aftermath of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda against the minority Tutsi, moderate Hutus and members of a third ethnic group, the Twa, had a particularly devastating impact on eastern DRC, contributing to two major conflicts. These were often referred to as the First Congo War (1996–1997) and the Second Congo War (1998–2003). Sometimes called “Africa’s World War”, these conflicts involved numerous African nations and armed groups fighting on Congolese soil.   Impunity for human rights abuses and violations, including war crimes and crimes against humanity, has plagued the region. Perpetrators are rarely held to account. Victims are often denied the justice that is needed to break the vicious cycle of violence that has tormented the people of the DRC.  The DRC and its neighbouring countries across the African Great Lakes region share a long history of brutal violence, exploitation and suffering that dates back to the 16th century.   Slavery and colonization, first under the Belgian King Leopold II and then under the Kingdom of Belgium, was characterized by barbaric violence, including mass abductions and murder, mutilations, extraction and plundering of natural resources and other violations. The colonial power also practised ‘divide and conquer’ tactics, which exacerbated deeply entrenched rifts between communities and ethnic groups. These tensions persisted after even after independence from Belgium in 1960.   In 1994, 800,000 people were slaughtered during the genocide in Rwanda. The genocide was carried out by Hutu-led pro-government militia who targeted members of the Tutsi minority community and anyone who tried to protect them. A Tutsi-led rebellion ended 100 days of massacres by marching on Rwanda’s capital Kigali and pushing millions of Rwandans, including the militia and security forces that committed the genocide to cross the border and seek refuge in DRC, then called Zaire. Soon after, the new Tutsi-led government in Kigali joined forces with the armies of Uganda and Burundi, as well as Congolese armed groups, to invade the DRC and overthrow the Mobutu government.   The wars that followed are known as the First and Second Congo Wars (1996-1997 and 1998-2002). Some of the ongoing major armed conflicts in eastern DRC are a continuation of these wars. Numerous armed groups, arose out of this turmoil. Each of them with constantly evolving alliances and rivalries with the various political powers and state authorities party to the conflict. These interwoven conflicts were marked by a swath of crimes under international law and other human rights violations, including mass killings, enforced disappearances, rapes and other sexual violence, and torture.  The conflicts in the DRC have ignited a human rights catastrophe. Thousands of civilians are caught in the crossfire and sexual violence is rampant. War crimes and crimes against humanity have been documented. Those who survive the violence face mass displacement, hunger, disease and poverty.  Fighting between armed forces in the DRC is often characterized by targeted or indiscriminate attacks that result in mass killings and injuries. More than 6 million people have died as a result of conflict in the DRC since 1998, many of them killed by hunger and disease.   Today, civilians are being killed in intensified fighting across North Kivu province. Casualties include those living in sites for internally displaced persons, which are regularly the targets of bombings.  UN and NGO sources have reported mass rapes and sexual violence in the DRC, mainly against women and children. Some of the victims of these attacks are as young as nine years old. Sexual violence is endemic in the DRC with studies finding that over 1.5 million women in the country have been raped in their lifetime.  Experts, including Nobel Peace Prize winner Denis Mukegwe, describe rampant sexual violence in the DRC as a clear example of rape used as a weapon of war.   Thousands of people have been subjected to torture and other cruel treatment as a result of the fighting in DRC. In 2022, a UN report found that both state authorities and non-state armed groups subjected people to torture.   There are also cases of enforced disappearances or arbitrarily detentions, among other abuses.   Fighting in the DRC has fuelled a humanitarian disaster, with millions forced to flee their home in search of safety. As of April 2024, 7.3 million people have been internally displaced by conflict, making it one of the largest displacement crises in the world.   People living in the areas most impacted by the conflict, including internally displaced people, are isolated from supply routes. This, paired with poor access to healthcare, food and shelter as well as substantial overcrowding and a lack of resources for aid, presents a catastrophic humanitarian crisis.    Despite the presence of valuable resources like cobalt and copper, the DRC is among the five poorest nations in the world. It’s estimated that 74.6 per cent of the country lives on less than US$2.15 per day in 2023.   The lack of economic opportunities is a barrier preventing people’s access to their human rights to healthcare, food and education. It also fuels armed conflicts and intercommunal violence.    Justice and accountability are essential to breaking this cycle of violence. Perpetrators of crimes under international law and other atrocities should be investigated, prosecuted and punished before the courts, whether national or international. Survivors and victims have a right to get justice for what they suffered.  In addition to better access to justice, states must also address historical grievances and ensure they provide and facilitate truth and reparations. Acknowledging the pain of the 6 million victims of DRC’s conflicts and making sure the world hears their stories will serve as a reminder of the true cost of war.    Every year, our global community comes together to fight injustice and support people whose human rights are under threat.

New Amnesty research shows the extent of the ongoing suffering of civilians trapped in fighting between the Myanmar military and the Arakan Army in Rakhine State. Here a 42-year-old Rohingya shopkeeper* from Maungdaw Township recounts his family’s desperate efforts to escape and reach a refugee camp across the border in Bangladesh. I never truly wanted to come to Bangladesh.  I lost my youngest son in a bomb blast on 1 August while he was playing outside the house. He was 4 years old and was one of the most loved members of the family. He was playing with his siblings and, being the youngest, he couldn’t run when the sound of the bomb was heard. The bomb struck near our house, and a small fragment hit my son, killing him. We left the village after we performed the funeral rites and buried him. I’m not sure who fired it – whether it was the Myanmar military or the Arakan Army (AA). After my son was killed, I sent my wife and the other children to Bangladesh with her mother’s family. They got a boat and sailed for Bangladesh. However, they were caught by robbers in the sea who took all their belongings.   Some male survivors on the boat were beaten and threatened. The robbers held a knife to my wife’s neck soon after capturing them. She tried to explain, “I have lost everything, including my son, and I fled the violence to save my life. I have nothing left to give you.” But they didn’t listen. They snatched her mobile phone, took her jewelry, and demanded her bag, which contained her clothes.  The family spent the entire night and the next day on the boat without any food, before finally reaching Bangladesh in the evening.  I sent my father’s family [to Bangladesh] on 5 August, the day after I sent my wife and children. I was hoping that the fighting would calm down so I could bring them back to Myanmar.   The situation had become very dangerous. On 6 August, the Arakan Army entered our village and relocated all the Hindu and Buddhist families to a safe area. Then, they began causing unrest [using it as a base to launch attacks] in the village, which forced us, the Muslim families, to leave on 7 August. We were the only ethnic group left in the village. It seemed like they did this intentionally.  I also saw conscripted Rohingya fighting alongside the Myanmar military. The AA was [also] able to conscript Rohingya people because they conscripted all of them from the rural areas where people in those villages could not disobey the orders of the AA.  My remaining relatives and I left our village and went downtown [in Maungdaw], seeking refuge. The AA came downtown and ordered people to leave. There were only a few families left. The AA members came to us and threatened, “If you don’t leave immediately, we will shoot you.”  In the morning of 15 August, I witnessed the AA kill a woman right on the spot with gunfire while she went to a pond to collect water … there was another man who was sitting and smoking in front of his house and he too was shot right in his head and killed. Around 9am the next morning, we left the town on foot. We were part of a group of around 150 people. However, when we tried to make our way to the border, the AA blocked the road. They told us, “You won’t be able to leave today. Go back to where you came from and stay in any house you like.”   We spent the night…covering our mouths and noses because there were dead bodies all over the place. We couldn’t sleep properly, and we had to endure this for five days as all the roads were blocked by the AA.  The AA was conducting investigations and identifying people who had joined the Myanmar military. One day, while I was at a tea shop with a friend, the AA came in and called my friend away. I haven’t heard from him since. I have no idea if he is still alive or if he was killed.  [Myanmar military] fighter jets were flying over the village where we had been stuck for five days, and we could hear the sounds of massive explosions in the nearby villages. I thought to myself, if a bomb were to hit one of the houses here, we would die in groups.  Before we ran out of money we made the decision to leave. The boat started at 10pm. They kept us on an island for two hours. A group of men came with guns. I thought they were Rohingya, they demanded money. I asked who they were, they said “shut up, keep silent.” The boatman negotiated with them and paid.   I arrived in Bangladesh on 25 August. We reached a house and suddenly there was a light from a torch. It was the border guards. We ran, found a pit, and hid there [until it was safe to come out].  All my surviving family members, including my father’s family, are now here in Bangladesh, but we are not living in one place as we don’t have our own shelter. We are staying with relatives.  My last request, since we are not safe here or there: I want to resettle in a third country. I now don’t want to be in Myanmar at all.  *This testimony has been edited for length and clarity. Amnesty’s full findings, including the Arakan Army’s response to allegations, can be found here.

0,Yanette: My sister was forcibly disappeared by the Colombian military,AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2024/10/yanette-my-sister-was-forcibly-disappeared-by-the-colombian-military/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? Yanette Bautista was just 27 when her sister Nydia was forcibly disappeared in 1987. Three years later, Yanette found Nydia’s remains – she had been murdered by state authorities and her whereabouts concealed to her family. It was the first time she learnt about enforced disappearances, an issue that is rife in Colombia – even today – with an estimated 200,000 people disappeared between 1985 and 2016 according to the 2022 Final Report of Colombia’s Truth Commission. Since her sister’s enforced disappearance, Yanette, now 66, has dedicated her life to supporting Colombian women to search for their loved ones without fear. She has set up her own organization, as well as spearheaded a new bill that became a law in 2024, calling for better protection for women searchers. In honour of the bill, Colombia has recently introduced International Women’s Searchers Day, which takes place on 23 October.  Here she tells her incredible story, spanning three decades… I found my sister three years after she was taken away and disappeared. I knew it was her. She was wearing the same clothes she had on the day she disappeared. It had been a day of celebration, the day our children received their first communion. When we found Nydia, she was still wearing the same dress and a jacket I had lent her. The only thing missing was her underwear. There was no reason for her underwear to be missing. I had to beg the authorities to hand her body over. I even threatened to go on hunger strike. When they eventually agreed to give me Nydia’s body, they handed it over in a trash bag. My sister was forcibly disappeared when I was 27. At the time, I didn’t know enforced disappearances existed. She was studying economics at university. We knew she was part of an opposition guerrilla group, M-19, that signed a peace agreement and became a legal political party a couple of years later. We thought that the worst that could happen was for her to be sent to jail by a judge for her political activities. It felt shocking to learn that we lived in a country where there was a huge lack of human rights. If you supported the opposition, you paid for it. It was a situation of desperation and confusion. My father and I started searching together – we went to hospitals, to military brigades, to the police intelligence, the secret police and the jails to see what could have happened. It was dangerous from the beginning as I started to be threatened many times just for asking for her. Eventually I was forcibly displaced. I left my home, sent my children to live elsewhere and I moved to another location. I soon started receiving anonymous calls. On one occasion, someone said: ‘Don’t look for her, she’s fine.’ It wasn’t a comforting call, and I knew I had to continue searching. I sought help from the Colombian NGO Committee for Solidarity with Political Prisoners (CSPP) and we were provided with legal assistance, while the Association of Family Members of Disappeared Detainees (ASFADDES) shared advice. While I searched for my sister, I started working with other families and we eventually got in touch with Colombia’s Inspector for Human Rights – he was determined to help. He somehow found a witness who claimed to know where Nydia was. By that point I didn’t have hope we would find her alive. I’d come to realize that those searching for their loved ones, were searching for people who had been murdered. A case was opened, and the well-known lawyer Eduardo Umaña took it on. I was told the witness was part of the Colombian military. He wanted to confess and said Nydia had been murdered and was buried in a rural town near Bogota. Together, with the inspector, forensic experts and our lawyer, we exhumed the body. I immediately knew it was her, even though she had been buried under NN (No Name). After Nydia disappeared, my life changed. I used to be an executive secretary for an important CEO, but it felt artificial after I started searching. I found it impossible to continue in this bubble, while people were being forcibly disappeared. That’s why I took off my heels and put on my shoes so I could start searching. After my sister disappeared, life changed. So I took off my heels and put on my shoes so I could start searching for her. Even though we found Nydia’s body, we have never got the justice we deserve. The inspector for human rights sanctioned in 1995 one general and four military officials – a first in our country. However, two months later, he had to flee because he started receiving threats. During that time, I was calling for a change in law, speaking out about the military – and I was eight months pregnant. I was under constant surveillance. Eventually the four sanctioned men were set free even though it was clear it was the military committing these crimes. By this time, it was too dangerous for me to stay in Colombia. Following a trip to Germany I just couldn’t come home. In 1997, I was forced into exile for seven years. During this time, I worked for Amnesty International, writing and researching about violence against women. I also became President of Federation of Family Members of Disappeared Persons (FEDEFAM), working with victims of forced disappeared in different countries. When I eventually returned to Colombia in 2007, I started my own organization. I’d met people from the Philippines, Albania, Kosovo, Turkey. We had so much collective knowledge. I wanted to empower families to search for their loved ones, so we started our organisation in my living room, with a small group of families. Our collective, Nydia Erika Bautista Foundation, is designed for women to help one another. There’s no hierarchy. It is an exchange of knowledge. We provide legal support, document stories and advocate. We have a leadership school to empower the women searching in different parts of the country. We work in eight regions of Colombia and we are supporting 519 cases. Our collective is mostly women – our research has revealed 95% of those searching for their loved ones are women – they’re mothers, sisters and wives. In a patriarchal society, it’s a task handed to the caregivers. But to me, we’re more than caregivers. When women start searching, we become human rights defenders – searching fearlessly, we challenge the rules of silence and oppression imposed by those who disappeared our loved ones, and we end up defending the rights of everyone. The women who search are incredibly brave, even though there is no support from the authorities and no political will to investigate these crimes. In fact, enforced disappearance isn’t seen as a crime – it’s normalized; sometimes it’s even justified by the Colombian authorities. As a collective, we want to turn our pain into rights. That’s why we wrote a law in a bid to empower women searching for the forcibly disappeared and to promote the rights of these women. It was signed into law in 2024. However, our next task is to ensure it is implemented and becomes a reality. We have so many allies supporting us, including Amnesty International, and it is spurring us on every day.  While I have hope going forward, advocating for this law brings fear. As I continue to call for change, enforced disappearances are continuing, women searchers are suffering violence, and our funds are decreasing – making our work even tougher. However, in my darker moments, I remember Nydia. Nydia dreamt of an army of women, who were armed with voices, not guns. I am determined to pursue her dream, so women can search without fear of suffering violence or of not having food at their family’s table, so women can search with freedom and dignity.

0,Why should India’s human rights record matter in its bid for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council?,AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2024/10/why-should-indias-human-rights-record-matter-in-its-bid-for-a-permanent-seat-on-the-un-security-council/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? There has been much talk of late about the possibility of India joining the UN Security Council (UNSC) as a permanent member, while most of the current permanent members have expressed public support for expansion of the UNSC. India has been falling far short of its domestic and international human rights obligations, and its desire to expand its role in the UN presents an opportunity to assess its record of engagement as a member of other UN political bodies, including the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC). It’s important to review India’s pattern of engagement with the human rights architecture as a whole, including with  the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and UN human rights treaty bodies. Such analysis, as presented below, indicates that India has not been a strong leader at the UNHRC, willing to take difficult and principled stands with consistent application of human rights values; nor has it engaged particularly constructively with Council mechanisms. There is much room for improvement on India’s engagement with the human rights system in relation to its own domestic human rights challenges. The UNSC is – theoretically – the most powerful political UN body, with a mandate to maintain international peace and security. It has 15 members: five permanent and 10 elected. The five permanent members are China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States. The non-permanent members are elected for a term of two years. The Security Council can establish peacekeeping operations, impose sanctions or arms embargoes, instruct human rights investigations, authorize the use of force, create international criminal tribunals and refer cases to the International Criminal Court. So far, India has been a non-permanent member of the UNSC eight times, its last term being in 2021-2022. It has now bid for the 2028-2029 term. Besides equitable geographical distribution, the UN Charter underlines the contribution of the candidate to the maintenance of international peace and security as an important consideration for membership. In 2021, the then UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet said “although it is the primary responsibility of the Human Rights Council, promoting and protecting human rights is one of the best ways for the Security Council to achieve its mandate of maintaining international peace and security.” Bearing that in mind, it is crucial to take a quick look at India’s engagement with the UN human rights system in the past few years. India has been a member of the UNHRC for 16 of the Council’s 18 years – most recently from 2019 to 2024.Resolution 60/251 that created the UNHRC states that “members elected to the Council shall uphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights, shall fully cooperate with the Council, and be reviewed under the universal periodic review mechanism during their term of membership”. Whether India has fulfilled these criteria is debatable. It has been the subject of around 25 statements from UN human rights experts and OHCHR since 2019 – during its last two terms of membership – expressing concerns about its domestic human rights issues and lack of compliance with its international human rights obligations. With regards to promoting and protecting human rights as a Council member, India currently takes a leadership role in just two of the many thematic issues addressed by the Council, and in no country-specific resolutions – demonstrating a lack of leadership on critical human rights issues. With regard to the UPR –  a mechanism by which every state’s human rights record is examined and recommendations for improvements made  – India has not shown progress in implementing recommendations, indicating a lack of substantive good-faith engagement in the mechanism. In its last UPR review, at least 21 countries urged India to improve its protection of freedom of religion and rights of religious minorities, with several raising concerns over increasing violence and hate speech and the government’s adoption of discriminatory policies such as “anti-conversion” laws. In addition, 19 countries said that India should ratify the UN Convention against Torture, a treaty it signed in 1997 but never ratified. India said in both the 2012 and 2017 UPR cycles that it remained committed to ratifying the treaty. However, it hasn’t taken steps to fulfil its commitment even as torture and other ill-treatment continue to be used routinely by police and other security forces to gather information or coerce “confessions”. Between 24 January 2011 and 24 September 2024, the Indian government received over 200 communications from UN Special Procedures, a collection of independent experts created by the HRC and mandated to monitor and report on human rights across the globe. The Indian government has only responded to less than a third of the communications it has received. After the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party came into power in 2014, India has facilitated the completion of only two visits by a UN special procedure mandate to the country. It currently has 19 pending visit requests. Some have gone unanswered since 1999 (for example, from the Special Rapporteur on Torture). India is party to only six of the nine human rights core treaties. India ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) in 1979 and underwent its fourth periodic review, a process where member states submit reports to the Human Rights Committee on the enjoyment of civil and political rights in the country, in 2024 after a long gap of 27 years since its third review in 1997. The Human Rights Committee raised the same concerns that civil society has been warning about for decades, namely India’s failure to meet international human rights standards to address: India ratified the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) in 1976 and underwent its last review in 2008, eighteen years after the prior review. In its concluding observations, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights noted that India had provided incomplete, undetailed information and did not answer some of the questions posed to the country, which impacted the assessment. The Committee pointed to the absence of effective domestic mechanisms to effectively implement the Covenant and raised concerns regarding: The sixth periodic report is currently 13 years overdue. While the implementation of the recommendations remains to be seen, the current government has started to crackdown on people’s economic, social and cultural rights in reprisal to those who exercise their civil and political rights. Amnesty International has documented the Indian authorities’ use of forced evictions and punitive demolitions as a means of meting out extra-judicial punishment to religious minorities like Muslims who dare to protest against the government’s majoritarian policies. In addition, India’s reports under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the Convention on the Rights of the Child are also overdue. India has also been the subject of two reports, in 2018 and 2019, from the OHCHR on the situation of human rights in Kashmir. Both reports called on the Indian authorities to respect international human rights obligations in the region, repeal or amend repressive laws such as the Armed Forces (Jammu and Kashmir) Special Powers Act and the Jammu & Kashmir Public Safety Act, end restrictions on journalists and investigate all blanket bans or restrictions. However, instead of meaningfully engaging with the OHCHR, the Indian authorities called the reports “false, with a motivated narrative” and accused the human rights body of “legitimising terrorism”. On 5 August 2019, the Indian government unilaterally repealed the critical provisions of Article 370 of the Indian Constitution – which had guaranteed far-reaching powers to the state of Jammu & Kashmir on a wide range of issues except foreign affairs, defence and communication – and extended its control over the region. Jammu & Kashmir was then deprived of its statehood and split into two separate union territories governed by the central government. The move was seen as a brutal dismissal of decades of protests against the human rights violations committed by the state and security forces in Jammu & Kashmir and an aggressive gesture to deprive the state’s inhabitants of their fundamental freedoms. India has consistently been included in the UN Secretary-General’s report on reprisals, which sets out cases of alleged reprisals – against individuals and organizations – for cooperation with the UN in the field of human rights. In the 2020 report, the Secretary-General concluded that “ongoing intimidation and reprisals have reportedly deterred some civil society representatives from cooperating with the United Nations for fear of further retribution” in the country. Discussions about reforming the UNSC should not be done in isolation of candidates’ performance and behaviour at other UN bodies, most importantly human rights ones. Membership of any of the UN organs should be used to shine a spotlight on, and protect human rights, not to shield members or their allies from scrutiny of their human rights record. It is abundantly clear that India is falling short of its domestic and international human rights obligations and its commitments as a member and in its interactions with different UN bodies and mechanisms. The discussion on reform of the Security Council may not end soon, but if India is serious about its intention to be a potential permanent member of the UNSC, it needs to demonstrate that it can engage responsibly with UN human rights entities, including the UNHRC. It must comply with the membership criteria to the UNHRC in a consistent and principled manner. It should commit to upholding the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights to fully cooperate with the UN human rights mechanisms.

0,Climate change and health – what’s the connection?  ,AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2024/10/climate-change-and-health-whats-the-connection/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? Climate change is increasingly driving violations of the right to life and the right to health. In fact, climate change has been called “the greatest global health threat facing the world in the 21st century”.  Extreme weather events, including heatwaves, flooding, droughts, wildfires and tropical cyclones, which are increasingly made much more likely and more severe by human-induced climate change, pose a serious threat to people’s right to mental and physical health. Not only are people injured and killed in these events, but public health facilities may be damaged or destroyed, and illnesses can spread among people who are displaced.   An increase in extreme heat in all regions has resulted in more people dying and becoming ill, more occurrence of disease, and more people migrating.  The number of deaths from climate change is expected to be significant, and an even larger number of people will develop disabilities and health conditions. The World Economic Forum estimates that, by 2050, climate change will result in 14.5 million deaths worldwide.   The burning of fossil fuels – coal, oil and gas – is the primary driver of climate change. Moreover, the extraction, processing, transport and burning of fossil fuels is bad for the health of communities that live close to these operations.   Burning fossil fuels is also one the main causes of air pollution – a significant driver of ill-health. Air pollution has been linked to heart disease, strokes, lung cancer, asthma and other chronic diseases. One study estimates that more than 5 million people die each year from air pollution caused by fossil fuel use.   For these reasons, Amnesty has endorsed a proposal for a Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty which aims to accelerate the transition to renewable energy.  Scientists are becoming faster and more accurate at assessing the extent to which climate change has influenced a particular weather event. Networks of scientists such as World Weather Attribution and Climate Central carry out rapid attribution studies to understand the role of climate change in individual floods, droughts, hurricanes, wildfires and other extreme weather events.  For example, in April and May 2024, countries across the Asian continent including Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, Myanmar, Thailand, Viet Nam and the Philippines saw temperatures well above 40°C for many days, exacerbating risks to health for people living in refugee camps and conflict zones, including 1.7 million displaced people in Gaza. World Weather Attribution found that these heatwaves were being made more frequent and more extreme by climate change.    The impacts of climate change on the right to health are felt everywhere, on every continent. However, communities on the frontline of climate change are among those worst affected.   A wide range of socio-economic factors affect whether people can lead healthy lives. They include people’s access to food, housing and water, access to healthcare, the extent to which they face marginalization because of racism, xenophobia, homophobia and sexism, and whether they live in a healthy environment. This means that the following people are among those at higher risk from climate-related health harms:  If steps to address climate change do not prioritize those who are made most vulnerable to it, climate change stands to deepen global inequality and put people who are already at risk of poor health in greater danger of becoming unwell.  Most states across the world have agreed to be bound by international human rights instruments that require them to respect, protect and fulfil human rights, including the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. Climate change needs to be seen as an issue of injustice, similar to how we think about other human rights violations.   All of Amnesty’s climate justice work highlights the impacts of climate change on human rights and proposes steps to prevent and recover from these harms. This includes campaigning for an end to fossil fuel use, and campaigning for increased climate financing from the countries that are most responsible for climate change, to promote climate justice in the countries least responsible.   Amnesty has already published research on climate-related health harms in numerous countries, including:  Amnesty’s research has also exposed how governments have failed to protect the procedural rights of communities who live close to fossil fuel operations, including their rights to access to information, public participation, justice, effective remedies and, in the case of Indigenous Peoples, the right to free, prior and informed consent.  Two examples are the Wet’suwet’en Nation’s struggle against the Coastal Gas Link pipeline in Canada, and the Ogoni people harmed by Shell’s operations in Nigeria.  Amnesty International is not the only global human rights organization to have begun highlighting how climate change undermines health. Human Rights Watch, for example, has published studies into the health harms of climate change on First Nations people in Canada, people with disabilities and older people in British Columbia, low-income Black and brown pregnant people in the USA, and people with disabilities in Spain.   Other organizations have conducted similar studies, including on the health impacts of heatwaves, the threat of wildfire smoke and the disproportionate impacts of climate change on LGBTI people.  With your help, we’ll continue to advocate for better human rights protections in the face of the climate crisis.

0,Nigeria: Empower girl survivors of Boko Haram,AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2024/10/nigeria-empower-girl-survivors-of-boko-haram/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? Girls and young women in north-east Nigeria suffered horrific abuses in Boko Haram captivity, with many survivors then arbitrarily detained and subsequently neglected by the Nigerian authorities. Now, these girls and young women are sending a clear message: they want to rebuild their lives. For more than a decade, Boko Haram used these girls and young women as “wives”, forcibly marrying them, and subjecting them to years of domestic servitude and sexual violence, including forced pregnancy.  Today, on International Day of the Girl Child, Amnesty International is launching a new petition calling for Nigeria’s President Bola Tinubu and the Nigerian government to empower these girls and young women by ensuring their access to medical care, education, and livelihood support. Join our call demanding Nigeria’s President Bola Tinubu and the Nigerian government empower these girls and young women by ensuring their access to medical care, education, and livelihood support. Earlier this year, Amnesty International released a major report ‘Help us build our lives’: Girl survivors of Boko Haram and military abuses in north-east Nigeria documenting how girls survived trafficking and crimes against humanity by Boko Haram, alongside the international campaign #EmpowerOurGirls. Many girls and young women who escaped Boko Haram returned to government-controlled areas with unique needs. The crimes that they endured have long-lasting consequences that are specific to their age and gender, including health complications, lack of access to education, as well as stigma and rejection by their families and communities. HM, a survivor who spent around 10 years in Boko Haram captivity, added: “I want to start my life afresh. [There are] so many things I need, I don’t know where to start.” “I want to forget that I once lived with Boko Haram. I want to come out of this camp and start all over again” Despite some family reunification efforts, the Nigerian government has largely failed to promote their physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration, as required by the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child to which Nigeria is a state party. These girls and young women have found the courage to speak out, and are now claiming their lives back.

0,#FreeTheFive Blog: Pensador,AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2024/10/freethefive-blog-pensador/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? 16 September marked  one year since Pensador has been arbitrarily detained. We met with his fiancé, Lemba Cahungo, who describes what an entire year, without her partner has been like. Activist Abraão Pedro Santos, AKA Pensador (37) had everything ready and organized for his wedding ceremony in October 2023. Still, he ended up being arrested, tried and sentenced to two years and five months in prison before he could fulfill his dream, simply for joining a planned protest on 16 September 2023, in Luanda, the capital of Angola. Pensador was not the only one to be sentenced for participating in the planned demonstration, he is part of the AGPT, the group of four activists sentenced on 19 September 2023. Pensador’s fiancée, Lemba, received us with a smile on her face, opened the door of her home and her heart to talk about her fiancé’s arrest and the impact it had on her life. She shared what it means to dream of building a family and suddenly see everything falling apart for no reason. Lemba begins by describing how she met Pensador in 2017, at church, but it wasn’t until three years ago that they formalized their relationship and had already set a wedding date. “My fiancé’s dream is to get married and to start a family. He always said he couldn’t wait to get home and be welcomed by his children.” “Abraão(as she calls him) had started a law degree but was unable to continue his studies. He is very intelligent. Likes reading books and loves Pepetela (an Angolan writer). He grew up inspired by his father, who also has several books. He loves watching entertainment programs and eating, usually pasta with fish. He’s also a big fan of Azagaia (a Mozambican artist)… This is what I knew about Abraão. He never revealed to me he was an activist”. “At the beginning of our relationship, I thought it was strange the way he dressed. He had long hair, wore military-type clothes, grew beards and wore boots. I could tell he was someone with his own ideas, but I didn’t think he was an activist. Eventually I found out a few years ago and told him that if he wanted to pursue activism, he should forget about me. He pretended to listen and even walked away from activism for a while, at least that’s what I thought”. Pensador has been an activist since 2011, when several young people took to the streets to demand an end to the rule of former president Jose Eduardo dos Santos, who at the time had been in power for 32 years. “Those who get involved in activism in Angola risk their lives. This fear hangs over us. There was a time when the authorities were looking for activist Gangasta, it became terror. I wouldn’t want something similar to happen to someone close to me. I think activism is essential. I can’t keep quiet in situations of injustice, even in my job I often demand better working conditions. I know it’s necessary. Activists want the best for the country, but unfortunately the police always act in bad faith and the consequence is that activists are often beaten, arrested or shot”. If Pensador was hiding about his activism, what did he say before he left the house on the morning of 16 September ? We asked. “Abraaosaid he was going to the church to fix some speakers. Of course, he couldn’t tell the truth because I wouldn’t agree. Around 4pm, one of his friends called me to ask about Pensador(Abraao), and I said he was at the church. The friend then revealed that Pensador  was arrested, and that the information was already circulating on Facebook. When I saw the news, I started shaking from head to toe. I cried bitterly, but I thought it was just a few hours’ detention and that maybe he would be released the same day, but he wasn’t.” A group of activists had called for a demonstration on 16 September 2023, in solidarity with motorcycle taxi drivers who were being restricted from carrying out their activities on some areas of the city. For the organizers, the restrictions were unfair, and several young people could be at risk of becoming unemployed and that would contribute to the already high levels of poverty in Angola. The demonstration had been duly communicated, but as usual, the police arrived moments before the demonstration began, and without any warrant, arrested the activists. On 19 September 2023, Pensador  and other three other activists were summarily tried,  convicted and sentenced. The public prosecutor initially accused them of “outrage and injury to the President of the Republic” because  one of them was holding a placard with words saying “President Joao Lourenço is incompetent”. Amid various inconsistencies and lack of evidence, the charge was changed to ‘disobedience and resisting orders.’ Witness reports and videos circulated showed that at the time of their arrest, the activists were lying on the ground, not resisting. Without any evidence, the court sentenced AGPT to two years and fivemonths in prison and fined them 80,000.00 Kwanzas (approximately USD100 ) each. Their lawyers submitted both an appeal and complaint against the decision, but both were rejected by the court. A curious fact, as described by the lawyer in the case, Dr. Zola Bambi, was that while still in the courtroom when the judge read out the sentence, there were only three names (Adolfo Campos, Tanaice Neutro and Gildo). Moments later, when the clerk returned to the courtroom to read the minutes of the trial, Pensador’s (Abraao Pedro dos Santos)’ name was now on the list of those convicted, and it was at that moment that Pensador discovered that he had also been convicted.  How was it like to visit Abraão for the first time in prison and how he’s doing? “When I saw him for the first time in the prison, I started crying and he cried too as we hugged. That was the last time I touched Abraão. When I go to visit him, there’s a barrier that separates us, we stand in different places. I can’t even see his full body. The bars are so thin that your fingers can’t get through”.“We spend hours talking while standing until we run out of things to talk about. When I go to see him, I always try to bring him positive things. I tell him about the nieces he likes and that  calms him down”.  “I miss Abraão so much. He’s very intelligent, a little special box of surprises. He always has good ideas to offer, and sometimes I get lost on my own. I need him. I need to talk to him. He loves going after his dreams. All I want is for my fiancé to be released. He didn’t commit any crime. The criminals are the ones who should be locked up.” The rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly  are constantly being violated in Angola. Like Pensador every year there are several documented cases of injustice committed against people who decide to take to the streets and protest for their rights or those of their communities. Stand up for Pensador  and three other activists who are arbitrarily detained simply for the peaceful exercise of their human rights.  Sign this petition and share it on your networks using the hashtag #Freethefive #FreeAGPT.

0,Why do we need a standalone Convention on Crimes against Humanity? ,AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2024/10/why-do-we-need-a-standalone-convention-on-crimes-against-humanity/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? Crimes against humanity refer to certain crimes committed as part of widespread or systematic attacks against a civilian population. They shock the conscience of humanity itself. The first prosecution using the term occurred when Nazi leaders were tried at Nuremberg last century, in response to the horrors of the Holocaust.  Such crimes include, but are not limited to:   Unlike war crimes, they can occur during peace or wartime. Some likely recent examples include:  These are just some examples of crimes against humanity, but there are many others that are equally egregious. In the past decade alone, Amnesty International has found cases of such atrocities in at least 18 countries across the world. No region of the world is free from crimes against humanity.  Currently, a number of legal mechanisms are specifically designed to tackle these crimes, such as the Rome Statute of the ICC and, more recently, the Ljubljana-Hague Convention. .   The Rome Statute is aimed at prosecuting individuals for their personal criminal responsibility. It was adopted as a means to establish the International Criminal Court in The Hague. In most cases, however, the court only has jurisdiction when a state is a member. Even then, the court can only act if that state is unable or unwilling to investigate and prosecute cases itself.  Some countries have also criminalized crimes against humanity themselves without being party to the Rome Statute, such as the Philippines and Indonesia.   National courts can, and in some circumstances must, prosecute individuals for crimes against humanity committed wherever they happen. This is because such crimes concern the international community as a whole and every state should act to protect people against them.  The above examples are important legal instruments and they do share some overlap. However, fundamental differences exist in their respective scope and functions. Unlike other crimes under international law, crimes against humanity lack a specific, standalone convention.   The new draft convention seeks to close this impunity gap and harmonize approaches. It offers a chance to remedy some of the compromises made in Rome over 25 years ago. It would also help to incorporate the progression of international law since. The latter is especially important regarding gender equality and protection against gender-based crimes.   Newer initiatives that seek to strengthen the international justice system alongside existing mechanisms are not in competition — they are complementary. They will help us seek and deliver justice, truth and reparation for victims and survivors of crimes under international law.   A new convention would oblige states to ensure that such crimes are investigated and prosecuted, even if this means investigating their own actions. Furthermore, it would compel states to not only punish crimes against humanity but also to prevent them (as is similarly required under the Genocide Convention). It would also foster cooperation with other states, for example through mutual legal assistance.    The convention would offer new pathways for victims of crimes against humanity and provide a comprehensive framework for countries to incorporate these crimes into their national legal systems. This step alone would hugely reduce the ability of perpetrators to evade justice.  Victims and survivors would be the ultimate beneficiaries. Humanity needs to be able to seek justice and accountability when crimes against humanity are committed, and a new convention could help us do that.  Since 2017, Venezuelans have faced mass extrajudicial executions and arbitrary detentions, as well as excessive use of force by police during protests. There is a systematic policy of repression against political opponents and people who may be perceived as such. These abuses may constitute crimes against humanity and the perpetrators should be brought to international justice.   Many organizations, including Amnesty, called on the UN to act by renewing the mandate of its Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Venezuela. In 2021 the ICC also finally recognized the need to investigate the potential crimes documented in Venezuela.  But other states can also help. A court in Argentina is presently considering a lawsuit brought by victims of crimes against humanity in Venezuela. Amnesty asserts that Argentine courts are fully competent to investigate, prosecute and criminally punish the perpetrators of crimes against humanity committed outside of Argentina. When authorities in a state where such crimes happen are unable or unwilling to enact genuine investigations and prosecutions, another state could enable the pursuit of justice.   The convention would not replace the actions of the UN or ICC, but function in parallel with them. Crimes against humanity are of concern to everyone. Concerted efforts are needed to combat them effectively. A new convention would give states a common global framework to tackle crimes against humanity, which would enable them to carry out investigations and prosecutions, foster mutual cooperation, and maintain fair trial procedures. It would also preserve the basic rights of victims and witnesses.  The convention project has been in the making for more than 10 years. In October and November 2024, the UNGA Sixth Committee will again discuss this topic. This presents a unique opportunity for states to demand that the UN begin the formal process of adopting this convention.   Amnesty asks all UN member states to support the adoption of a resolution that would initiate negotiations for a Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Humanity to begin. We urge governments to endorse the draft resolution currently being circulated prior to the October session.   In the past two years, a global majority of states have expressed general support for the project. If the UN does not move the draft text to formal negotiations, it may not be presented for discussion again for many years. As it stands, the need for an international treaty offering new possibilities for both preventing crimes against humanity and ensuring justice, truth and reparation remains as urgent as ever.  For over a decade, Amnesty experts have been advocating for better protections against crimes against humanity, including taking steps towards a Convention.

0,These two women are making abortions possible for those whose governments won’t allow it ,AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2024/09/these-two-women-are-making-abortions-possible-for-those-whose-governments-wont-allow-it/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? Verónica Cruz Sánchez, is a long-time campaigner for abortion rights in Mexico, who helped ensure girls and women who have been raped could access safe abortions. Nowadays, Veronica is helping USA-based women access abortion pills in the wake of the Roe Vs Wade reversal.   Years ago in Guanajuato and throughout Mexico, abortion for survivors of rape wasn’t available. While it was technically legal, our government did not provide the services women and girls needed.  We created our feminist organization Las Libres (the Free Ones) in 2000 because we wanted to promote women’s rights and be there for those who had been raped. It seemed completely inhuman to think that these girls would have to bring these pregnancies to term. We wanted to make sure their rights were upheld, so we formed a network of gynaecologists, along with psychologists and lawyers to help guarantee the right to free and safe abortion. We also wanted to support girls and women who wanted to terminate unwanted pregnancies at home without medical supervision by accessing abortion pills for free.  In 2002, I met several young women who were imprisoned for having miscarriages, obstetric emergencies and abortions. They were young, had barely turned 18 and were already in prison. Some had been raped, the majority lived in poverty and were from marginalized rural areas. One of the girls I met was still pale from blood loss – she’d been sent to prison straight from hospital. I knew I wanted to help. She shouldn’t have been there.   After we met, she introduced me to other young women who had been subjected to the same prosecution. My team and I started running workshops in prison as we wanted to understand their situation and reconstruct what had happened. There was one woman who eventually led all the others to freedom. Unlike the rest she hadn’t been sentenced yet, so we started litigating her case and eventually she was released. This victory helped us to raise awareness about similar cases and created a massive social outrage. Soon afterwards all the other women were out of prison.  Since then we have made progress and the Mexican Supreme Court ruled that abortion should be decriminalised throughout the country. But many federal states continue to criminalise abortion in many cases and women are still learning about their rights, so it is my job to educate them.   While Mexico has taken steps forward, it is super crazy to witness what is happening in the USA. The USA used to be a reference for Mexico, with everyone wanting a ruling like Roe vs Wade.   After the constitutional right to abortion was overturned in the USA, one journalist gave me the idea to replicate our model and help women in Texas. Our aim was to pass on our experience, the model and resources such as abortion pills, which weren’t easily available there. When Americans read about our work in the USA media, their reaction was amazing. Donations started flowing in, even small 10 dollars donations. And we were able to buy one year’s worth of pills to send to the USA for free.   To date, we have supported more than 20,000 women directly in the United States and formed more than 200 support networks across the country. Our networks are anonymous, as these people are at great risk of criminalization. Where possible, if someone wants to go to a clinic, we try and connect them with someone in an out-of-state clinic.   Abortion is a right for which the entire society needs to take responsibility and should not be just on the shoulders of women, girls and all those who need or want an abortion. When the State does not respond, social organizations such as Las Libres must come forward and help to solve this problem.   Malta legalized abortion six months ago, but only in cases where a woman’s life is at risk – meaning three medical specialists need to agree on a decision and be present in the hospital. It’s a ruling that means the majority of women in Malta still can’t access abortions. As the only openly pro-choice gynecologist in Malta, Isabel Stabile has been finding ways of supporting abortion rights for many years, despite the near total abortion ban… Most young people in Malta are brought up Catholic. I am 66 and I did my gynecology training in the UK. Although I didn’t carry out an abortion, I was always pro-choice, and I looked after women before and after their procedures. When I moved back to Malta 20 years ago to start my practice again, I realized how difficult the situation was for women. It wasn’t right and I needed to do something. Together with my colleagues, we set up a free local abortion doula service for women to call us before, during or after an abortion and ask for help – and it’s still running today. Medical abortion is a safe procedure and it can be done without medical supervision, provided you are reasonably close to hospital and have access to relevant information. Where possible, we speak to patients ourselves, using appropriate language to let them know the procedure. We also make them aware of two things: Firstly, that they understand what I am telling them is illegal. If they are caught, they will go to jail for three years and we will go to jail for four years and lose our medical license. Secondly, they have to do it themselves, as lots of people want to catch us out meaning we’re at risk. We try to minimize that risk as much as possible, by providing support during an abortion, and ensuring they know how much bleeding is normal and whether hospital is necessary. For me, the current situation in Malta is terrible, having moved from a complete ban to – what feels like – an almost the worst situation. Approximately six months ago, a new law was passed which said abortion was only possible if your life was at grave imminent danger. It required three specialist doctors, present in the hospital, to agree. It is dangerous. Doctors are waiting until the very last minute and they’re not following medical protocols. In the past, it would have been possible for a doctor, gynecologist or obstetrician to decide whether a pregnancy would put the mother at risk and help end it privately, but not now. The current situation in Malta is terrible, having moved from a complete ban to – what feels like – an almost the worst situation. I am in a difficult position – especially as women need help. For example, a 45-year-old woman, unable to speak English rang our doula line, saying she was pregnant. She had three children and wanted to end the pregnancy. I told her where to find the abortion pills and made sure she knew it was illegal. However, she didn’t know how to use the Internet. It’s not always easy. When I started, I received a lot of hate mail, saying “I wish you were dead. We will kill you.” I reported them to police but they didn’t do anything. Thankfully, things are changing, especially among young people. We can now have open conversations about abortion, while a recent survey revealed that the majority of people under 30 are in favour of the decriminalization of abortion. There are very few of us actively involved in my line of work. Yes, some people can be nasty, but fortunately there are some good people in the world and they’re the ones that help you get through problems. It can be hard when you don’t see immediate change, but we support each other as much as we can.

Uncertainty and human rights violations for Dominicans of Haitian descent By: Elena Lorac, co-coordinator of Movimiento Reconocido It was September 2013. I had managed to get accepted into university, but I still needed the identity card that would actually allow me to take classes. Then in the afternoon on Monday, 23 September 2013, at Centro Montalvo, we got news of the court’s decision in judgment 168-13 against Juliana Deguis, which stripped over 200,000 people of their nationality. The court had to find in our favour for me to be able to go the next day to get my identity documents and correctly enrol at the university. But it didn’t. It was a sorrowful afternoon, and the start of an 11-year road I am still on today. When I listened to the arguments of the lawyer and legal experts, I couldn’t wrap my mind around the court’s decision. I had no idea of the difficulties in store. The press amplified the news. We asked ourselves: why so much injustice, racism, discrimination, and segregation against a group of people who just want to make something of their lives? They say we’re foreigners, but we were born here. Why so many lies and double standards? Then the hate speech flared up, although others took a stand for our rights. I felt something similar in September 2023, when those convoys of war tanks and armoured trucks were bearing down on a people that just needs water: water is life, and so are the right papers for those who don’t have them. I just remember them saying: “How can they possibly take away the nationality of so many young people?” And then in the next news segment, I saw someone had been issued a card to regularize their migratory status and thought: “If they treat me as a foreigner, where would I go? What country would I go to? I have no ties to Haiti.” I thought about the Dominicans who go abroad and have children there, but they come back and they have houses, or their kids know the language. But I could barely speak Creole, and my parents no longer remember where they were born. 23 September 2013 was a pivotal moment for me, as it was for every Dominican of Haitian descent. On that day, our last modicum of hope was snuffed out. I remember that many of the people supporting us at the time said: “Don’t worry, this will blow over. There’ll be a solution.” I never imagined that today I would look back on over a decade that has passed since the cruel decision of the Constitutional Court, a body whose main function is to ensure people’s human rights but that instead breaks its own rules to legitimize an entire oppressive system of stigmatization and systemic racism that has prevailed throughout history, a system stacked against Dominicans of Haitian descent because we are black and trace our lineage to a nation that played a major historic role in the fight against slavery. Today marks 11 years since this terrible decision that validated all the administrative practices of the Central Electoral Board, practices that violated the human rights of those born in the Dominican Republic with the constitutional guarantee of jus soli (right of soil), a right that was reframed to instate a system that denies children of foreign parents—especially children of Haitians who came and contributed to this country—the right to Dominican nationality. I wish that today the discussion could be about well-being, about progress. I wish that instead of speaking to the realities that we Dominicans of Haitian descent endure in our country, we could be talking about economic development, or about how a Dominican of Haitian descent was accepted to Harvard a won awards there, or about business ideas we plan to pitch. Now, 11 years on, we should be talking about what we’ve put behind us and how far we’ve come. But we’re not. Instead of advancing human rights against a backdrop of rule of law and democracy, we find ourselves in an era of backsliding, even while much is being said about a government committed to change. But what kind of change? A change that will make the reality of black Dominicans of Haitian descent even worse? A change that will continue robbing thousands of youth of their dreams of studying, attending university, working, being able to register the births of their children, get married, or even do things as simple as buy a chip for their cell phone? It should not be impossible for parents to name their children, for young athletes to be signed on to teams and represent our country abroad, or for other youth to be able to achieve their dreams of practicing medicine or law, or starting a business to contribute to our economy and nation. Sadly, they can do none of these things, because the very state that should stand up for their rights and bring about a change does just the opposite, and instead takes backward and illegal action to arbitrarily detain and deport young people who were born in the Dominican Republic. It instead acts out the discrimination, inequity, and inequality that have dominated all these years of struggle and resistance. Today I urge the Dominican state, through its government, to return to lawfulness so that we can put statelessness—which the county continues to see as up for debate even now in the 21st century—behind us. So that the Dominican youth of Haitian descent, who for decades have been awaiting a real and effective response to the hijacking of our fundamental rights, can enjoy the same rights as the rest of the population. The Dominican state has an opportunity to fulfil its obligation to make reparations, which would restore our nationality not only by giving us identity cards, but also by giving us justice and respect for our fundamental human rights.

0,FreeTheFive Blog: Tanaice Neutro,AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2024/09/freethefive-blog-tanaice-neutro/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? 16 September marks one year since Tanaice Neutro has been arbitrarily detained. We met with his wife, Teresa Cuanga, who describes what an entire year, without her husband has been like. Teresa thought it was the end of a nightmare she never wanted to have again. What she didn’t know was that her happiness wouldn’t last long, as her husband Tanaice would be sent back to prison in less than three months after his release. On the morning of 16 September 2023, Tanaice Neutro told his wife he was about to join a demonstration in solidarity with the motorbike taxi drivers who were facing restrictions on their activities in some areas of Luanda, Angola’s capital. Hours before the demonstration was due to take place, Tanaice and other activists were surprised by the police, who without a warrant took all those present to the Criminal Investigation Services-SIC and that day, Tanaice and other activists never went home again. “That morning, I said, love, don’t go to the demonstration, you know there are always police there. He said he couldn’t cancel. He had already given his word to his friends. He told me nothing would happen, that I shouldn’t worry” said Teresa, who tells us in detail what happened on 16 September 2023 and introduces us to the profile of the man who could make history for serving a total of four years in prison solely  for peacefully exercising his right to freedom of assembly.   On 19 September 2023, Tanaice Neutro and other 3 activists were tried and convicted. The public prosecutor initially accused them of “outrage and injury to the President of the Republic”. Amid various inconsistencies and lack of evidence, the charge was changed to ‘disobedience and resisting orders.’ Witness reports and videos circulated showed that at the time of their arrest, the activists were lying on the ground, not resisting. Without any evidence, the court convicted and sentenced Tanaice and the other three activists (AGPT) to two years and five months in prison. Their lawyers submitted both an appeal and complaint against the decision, but both were rejected by the court. This is not the first time Tanaice Neutro has been arbitrarily detained.  We wanted to understand from Teresa, who is the man who is dedicating his life to fight for the right to protest in Angola, even though he knows the risks associated. Teresa begins by telling us how she met Tanaice and her activism. “Tanaice’s mother, my mother-in-law, was a good friend of mine. In 2015, she introduced me to her son and from there began a beautiful friendship that ended with our traditional and civil wedding. Tanaice is a kind person, he likes listening to Certanejo (a Brazilian musical rhythm), his favourite artist is Teixeirinha and his favourite song is by Teixeirinha and Mary Teresinha.”. “He wasn’t an activist when I first met him. He loves listening to music, composing and singing kuduro (Angolan musical style), at first he sang about common themes that didn’t give the Angolan government any headaches, until in 2021, when he released a song entitled ‘2022 vais gostar’(2022 you will like), which went viral in Angola.” “Tanaice’s dream is to one day own his own home, have a job and be able to see his children study and graduate. He also dreams of seeing a different Angola without suffering. He thinks a lot about people and would like to be able to help people more. He didn’t go to university, but if he ever had the chance, he would study law.” Since he was arrested in January 2022 and again in September 2023, Tanaice has gone on several hunger strikes, and his health situation is  sensitive due to him not receiving  adequate medical treatment in prison. “And now, how is he doing?” We asked. “I can say that he is recovering from his last hunger strike in February this year 2024. When I go to visit him, he just wants to know how his children are and if his stereo is still playing. He doesn’t regret going out to the protest that day and sometimes asks how the campaign for his freedom is going.” We also wanted to find out what Teresa thinks of Tanaice’s arbitrary detention and what it’s been like raising her four children on her own. “I miss Tanaice. It’s hard looking after the children on my own. They always ask when their father will be back and I say soon, but sometimes they hear news about their father on the radio. They know that their father is in jail and they know the reasons why. They used to see their father when he recorded videos here at home.” “It hurts a lot. Everything has stopped. Tanaice has committed no crime by criticizing President Joao Lourenço. If we have freedom of expression, then we must speak out. We can’t see things that aren’t right and not speak out. If we don’t hold our leaders accountable, who will? There will always be someone who must speak out”. Tanaice strongly believes in the right to freedom of peaceful assembly. One of Tanaice’s best-known songs is entitled ‘manifestação (demonstration/protest).”:  ‘(…) Demonstration is the right of a citizen who is unhappy, But it seems that Agostinho Neto didn’t explain this to the leaders (…) (…) Whenever an activist complains about a fair cause, they can’t arrest him or kill him We want the police to release the activist, the brother activist who is in prison (…) (…) If you don’t want the people to complain, President, do your job well. Don’t look down on me João Lourenço, listen to my advice First give Angolans the 500,000 jobs you promised. Then bring down the price of meat before the end of the year Also build schools and hospitals so the population will be happy Stop threatening with a gun everyone who’s a protester(…)”  “At first, I didn’t understand anything about activism until my husband was arrested. That’s when I realized that being an activist it’s a serious thing in Angola, it’s about life and death because you speak out against powerful people who can move heaven and earth to hunt you down. I’m afraid of losing my husband. I’m afraid that because of his activism, something will happen to me or the children.” “Since all this began, the hardest days are when I have to visit my husband in jail because I leave the baby at home for an almost two-hour journey. On the way to jail I often ask myself if I deserve to go through so much suffering and injustice, but I keep going. At night, I miss him more and wonder what he’s doing, how he woke up that day and if he’s eaten, especially on days when I can’t take food to the jail.” The right to freedom of peaceful assembly  is routinely  being violated in Angola. Like Tanaice, every year there are several documented cases of injustice committed against people who decide to take to the streets and protest for their rights or those of their communities. Stand up for Tanaice and three other activists who are detained solely the peaceful exercise of their human rights.

0,#FreeTheFive Blog: ADOLFO CAMPOS,AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2024/09/freethefive-blog-adolfo-campos/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? 16 September marks one year since Adolfo Campos has been arbitrarily detained. We met with his wife, Rosa Mendes, and their four kids, to hear more about what an entire year, without their father has been like. Rosa Mendes, opened her home and her heart to us, to talk to us about her husband’s Adolfo Campos’s imprisonment. Adolfo (45) was arrested on 16 September 2023, hours before taking part in a solidarity demonstration with motortaxi drivers after authorities announced restrictions in their circulation in some areas of Luanda, capital city of Angola. The demonstration had been duly communicated to authorities but  the police  arrested Adolfo and three other activists. On 19 September 2023, Adolfo, Gildo, Pensador and Tanaice Neutro, were summarily tried and convicted. Public prosecutor initially accused them of “outrage and injury to the President of the Republic” since one of them was holding a placard with words saying “President Joao Lourenço is incompetent”. Amid various inconsistencies and lack of evidence, the charge was changed to “disobedience and resisting orders” even though witness reports and videos circulated showed that at the time of their arrest, Adolfo and other activists were lying on the ground, not resisting. We met with Rosa who told us who Adolfo is and how his activism started. Rosa is joined by their four minor children. They also want to talk about their father; Rosa consents, we begin. “I met Adolfo in South Africa, in 2006. We were both studying there. In 2009 we started our relationship. We are now married, with four kids” Rosa says. The kids are now competing to show who knows their father better; “Daddy likes sports. He likes football, running and going to the gym. He would often watch soccer. He likes to eat banana, fruits and fish, he only eats fish. Our father likes Michael Jackson and Lucky Dube” they say. Their mother jumps in and adds “My husband loves reading political books and his favourite book is The Long Walk to Freedom, Nelson Mandela’s autobiography. He also likes to read newspapers”. “My father’s dream is to see everyone improving their lives, especially those who suffer the most. He wants to see  equality in Angola. He suffers a lot when he sees other people struggling” the kids said. Rosa immediately remembers some of Adolfo’s first actions in Angola. “The first demonstration he participated, was on 7 September 2011. Adolfo remained in prison for three months. That was the first time he was arrested” . “Since he started his activism, we never had a normal life. There were times he had to sleep in the car because he couldn’t get home. Several times we had to leave our own house because it was not safe. As a woman, we want our husbands on our side and have normal life projects as other couples, but we don’t have the freedom to do that”. “First quarter of 2023, while he was entering an amusement park with the kids, police surrounded the vehicle, while trying to take the kids out of the car. Kids were fighting, defending their father.” We had to stop as one of the young girls were breaking into tears remembering what she went through on that day. Her mother asked her to leave the room and get some water. We continued the conversation with Rosa. We wanted to understand what she thinks about her husband’s current imprisonment, in which she replied: “This is the longest detention since he started his activism, and the saddest part is that the planned demonstration didn’t even take place. I am shocked and surprised by the level of injustice in Angola. It’s affecting our family at all the levels, including emotionally.” “Many things have changed. He was the provider and used to take care of his mother as well. Now, I have to do everything, by myself. This is also affecting our children so much. The kids think their father is a hero, but they are tired of waiting for him to get out of the prison”. ‘Did you talk to him in the morning before he was arrested”, we asked? “We were together on that Saturday. It was my mother’s birthday party. He would be the DJ of the party. I was inside the house when he suddenly disappeared. I knew he had gone to the protest, but I was calm. I thought in a matter of hours he would be back as always, but he didn’t. At 9pm, I realized something was wrong. I took my car and drove trying to find out, where he was”.  What happened on the day of the trial? “On 19 September, I knew they would be sentenced, but when it actually happened, I froze. It was like a low blow”. When you visit him, what does he normally say?  “He is now teaching other prisoners how to read and write. In the beginning his morale was low, but now, since his health is sensitive, he is more positive and willing to get out and get better”. Several times Rosa reported her husband’s health wasn’t going well. After being checked by the doctors, it was recommended Adolfo undergoes urgent surgery, however the prison hospital doesn’t have the capacity to conduct such surgery. On 7 February 2024, his lawyer submitted a request so he could be transferred to a  prison hospital and,  permission for him to be checked by a private hospital for a surgeon. Seven months later, this request has not yet been responded to. What do you miss the most about your husband? Rosa was about to answer but kids came back to the living room and decided they are the ones who should answer that question. Their mother consented, so they started “We miss our father’s hug. We love when he brings cereals, candy’s, fried potatoes and biscuits. We miss spending the full day with him. When we are about to sleep, we go to him, and he often tell us a story”.  Rosa added “I miss my husband so much. We are very united as a couple. He has always been playful. People thought he would change after the marriage, but he is still the same loving, spiritual and playful person.” What do you think about people being arrested for defending other people’s rights? We asked. “People like my father shouldn’t be arrested. They are right to protest for the people. It’s unfair that activists are arrested, they should be considered heroes. Heroes are defending human rights. They want a better world for everyone, even if they themselves are doing fine, they will still use their time to defend the people, not everyone can do that.” We ended this conversation reflecting on the high price people like Adolfo are paying for their willingness to see their people have better living conditions. Adolfo’s kids are witnessing the injustice their father is facing. They are young but now they know that being vocal about injustice and inequalities can mean losing their freedom.  We are campaigning for the immediate release of Adolfo and others who are imprisoned solely for peacefully exercising their human rights, but we need your voice so we can achieve greater impact.

0,The collective resilience of justice in Guatemala,AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2024/09/the-collective-resilience-of-justice-in-guatemala/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? By Tania Briseño Oliveros Virginia Laparra is a Guatemalan lawyer who spent two years in prison through an unfair conviction and with whom Amnesty International has maintained a close relationship, having followed her case for several years. In May of this year, a small Amnesty International delegation visited Virginia in Quetzaltenango, Guatemala. Our encounter took place before the start of a second trial, at a time when there was still hope for a positive resolution. “I’m happy to be free, but I’m also tired. Stringing out the process for as long as possible is part of the torture, it’s already been 7 years. There is nothing legal about the process, everything is arbitrary,” she told us. I’m happy to be free, but I’m also tired. Stringing out the process for as long as possible is part of the torture, it’s already been 7 years. There is nothing legal about the process, everything is arbitrary. In order to understand Virginia’s case, we need to know that she was a public prosecutor with the Special Prosecutor’s Office against Impunity (FECI) which, together with the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG), played a key role in the fight against impunity and corruption in the country. These institutions succeeded in prosecuting high-ranking government officials and made significant progress in dismantling networks of corruption within Guatemala’s political and economic elite. However, this fight against corruption triggered a backlash from the political and private sectors and from the criminal groups affected by these new initiatives. Campaigns of stigmatization, harassment and defamation soon began against justice operators, human rights defenders and journalists who documented these cases. Unfortunately, the CICIG ceased to operate in 2019 after the government of Jimmy Morales decided not to renew its mandate. This marked the beginning of a difficult, unfair and painful period for many of those working against corruption within the justice system. In 2022, Laparra was arbitrarily detained because of her work defending human rights as the head of the FECI in Quetzaltenango. Amnesty International declared her a prisoner of conscience and called for her immediate and unconditional release, an action that was supported by the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention. Despite these efforts, she spent two years in prison, during which time she was separated from her daughters and subjected to human rights violations and lack of the medical care she required. Amnesty International considers a person to be a prisoner of conscience when they are imprisoned or otherwise physically restrained (such as being put under house arrest) solely because of their political, religious or conscientious beliefs, their ethnicity, sex, colour, language, national or social origin, socio-economic status, birth, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or other status, and if the circumstances leading to their detention did not involve the use of violence or advocacy of violence or hatred. Amnesty International calls for the immediate and unconditional release of all prisoners of conscience. “Designating Virginia as a prisoner of conscience was a way not only to fight for her case, but also to protect Claudia in her own case for acting as Virginia’s lawyer,” said Cristina Alonzo, lawyer for Claudia Gonzalez and now also for Virginia. Claudia is a renowned lawyer and human rights defender who was also a former CICIG official. In 2023, she went from being a lawyer for Virginia and other former prosecutors, to becoming a new victim of criminalization and arbitrary detention by the Guatemalan justice system. Designating Virginia as a prisoner of conscience was a way not only to fight for her case, but also to protect Claudia in her own case for acting as Virginia’s lawyer. On 23 May, Amnesty International published its report The entire system against us: Criminalization of women justice operators and human rights defenders in Guatemala. This report presents a number of cases, such as those of Virginia Laparra and Claudia González, and uses them to analyse the pattern of harassment and criminalization of justice operators and human rights defenders who have contributed to the fight against impunity and corruption in the country from a gender perspective. This pattern includes the filing of multiple complaints against justice operators, forcing them to invest time and resources in their defence; online attacks such as disinformation campaigns, harassment and violence in online spaces that portray them as criminals or leak sensitive information about their cases; personal harassment of victims and their families; improper criminal prosecutions in cases with no legal grounds; trials without due process; and arbitrary detentions. This pattern is repeated and extended to cover an increasing number of people working as defence lawyers, judges or prosecutors (as in the case of Virginia and Claudia). In many cases, criminalization leads to exile, with many of those affected being forced to leave Guatemala because of these practices and threats to their integrity or their lives. You give your profession, your life and your time to do your bit for something good, for justice. “You give your profession, your life and your time to do your bit for something good, for justice,” said Virginia. “I am now back to the life I missed out on for two years.” The lunch we shared in Quetzaltenango was a welcome meeting with Virginia and her family, as well as with Bernardo Caal Xol and Isabel Matzir, both human rights defenders. Bernardo was also declared a prisoner of conscience by Amnesty International for defending the indigenous Mayan Q’eqchi’ community and the Cahabón river. During the course of our meeting, Bernardo’s wife Isabel told us how she had learned more about Virginia’s case through the media, and how she started to see similarities with what they had experienced. Someone fighting for a just cause, who made people in power uncomfortable, and these people then used criminalization as a strategy to silence their voices. “Bernardo was in prison from 2017 to 2022. It was a great help for us to meet families who had gone through the same thing. It gave us hope: if they could get out, we could also get out. You can find peace in solidarity with other families.” It was a great help for us to meet families who had gone through the same thing. It gave us hope: if they could get out, we could also get out. You can find peace in solidarity with other families. Since Bernardo’s release from prison, he and Isabel have devoted much of their time, energy and resources to visiting imprisoned defenders who have been unjustly criminalised. Simply being with them, preparing their favourite food, providing them with books to help them through the process and, above all, listening to them and sharing their own experiences, is a very powerful gift of empathy that helps build a dignified, affective and collective resistance. A coming together in reflection of those who have experienced an involuntary pause in their life’s journey, often allowing them to heal. Bernardo shared his own thoughts. “I couldn’t cry. Days went by and I couldn’t cry. Until I saw another fellow defender. And when I saw her, I thought: ‘She was in prison. How did she cope? And how did I cope?’ I saw in her the pain I had experienced. But in prison there was only anger; I also thought it was a message to the enemy.” The struggle does not end with release from prison, and the taste of freedom is bittersweet. There is irreversible damage, and complex challenges to overcome. Harassment and criminalization have a negative impact on people’s lives at multiple levels, ranging from work and financial consequences to psychological, emotional and family issues. These are people who have often been subjected to intense and prolonged campaigns of vilification and stigmatization, with no guarantee that their trial or sentencing will be fair. In addition, persons deprived of their liberty have experienced adverse conditions such as lack of access to health services, misogynistic and racist attacks in public spaces or in the courts, restrictions on visiting rights, etc. On Thursday 18 July, Virginia took the difficult decision of going into exile in order to protect her life. This decision came a few days after she was found guilty by the Court of Quetzaltenango in the second of the two cases she was facing for allegedly revealing confidential information. She received a commutable sentence of 5 years’ imprisonment and a fine of 50,000 quetzales, as well as being banned from holding public office for ten years. “I take this step with great sadness and in the full knowledge that this decision will be particularly difficult for my family, my friends and my lawyers. I ask you to understand the difficulty of my decision and that I am doing this solely to protect myself and them,” she wrote in a letter. Laparra joins more than 50 justice operators, journalists, Indigenous leaders and activists in Guatemala who have gone into exile after denouncing political persecution against them by the Public Prosecutor’s Office following the closure of the CICIG in 2019. “I am more certain than ever that truth is on my side. And from exile, I state once again: this is something they will never be able to take away from me,” she added. I am more certain than ever that truth is on my side.

0,FreeTheFive Blog: Gildo,AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2024/09/freethefive-blog-gildo/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? “I didn’t know that Gildo had been arrested. When I called his phone, a prison guard picked up and that’s how I confirmed the information I saw on social media. Gildo had been arrested,” said Marcelina José, Gildo’s partner. Marcelina is with Gildo’s father and brother, she recalls the day of his arrest.  Hermegildo Jose Victor AKA Gildo das Ruas (29) was arrested on 16 September 2023, hours before taking part in a solidarity demonstration in solidarity with motorcycle taxi drivers, in Luanda, capital city of Angola. The motorcycle-taxi drivers were facing restrictions to circulate in some areas of Luanda. The protest had been duly communicated to the authorities in the city, however, the protest never took place. Police arrived on scene before the protest had begun and without any justification or warrant, the police arbitrarily arrested those who were present there. Gildo who had come  to participate in this protest, was also arrested in the police round up. On 19 September 2023, Gildo and other three activists[1] were tried and convicted. The Public prosecutor initially accused the four, of “outrage and injury to the President of the Republic”.Amid various inconsistencies and lack of evidence, the charge was then  changed to ‘disobedience and resisting orders.’ Witness reports and videos circulated, showed that at the time of their arrest, the four activists were lying on the ground, not resisting. Without any evidence “of disobedience and resisting orders”, the court sentenced Gildo, and his co-accused to two years and five months in prison and fined them 80,000 Angolan Kwanzas (approximately US$100 ) each. Their lawyers submitted both an appeal and complaint against the decision, but both were ignored by the court. We sat down with Gildo’s loved ones, his partner, Marcelina, his brother and his father, to learn more about the brave activist. Q: Who is Gildo and why will he spend around 880 days in prison without having committed any crime? A: I’m an informal seller at the market, and that’s where I met Gildo in 2020. He invited me to go out, and from there we became close to each other. I didn’t know he was an activist. When I found out, people discouraged me from continuing my relationship with him, but he always said I shouldn’t listen, and I didn’t” said Marcelina. Gildo’s father, José Gonga, saw Gildo grow into his activism,  “He was a calm kid. At the end of his adolescence, I noticed that his activism was getting stronger, but I wasn’t surprised because our family is from the lineage of Queen Njinga Mbande, the warrior”.  “A few years ago, I sent him to Luanda to study electricity, but he dropped to study political science. Although I didn’t like his decision, I understood why my son likes to defend Angola.”  “Gildo likes to chat on Facebook with his activist friends. He also likes reading books, especially by Pepetela (Angolan writer). The songs that put him in the best mood are by Força suprema (Angolan rap group)”.  Said Victor Gonga, Gildo’s brother. Q: Is this the first time Gildo has been arrested for his activism? What does the family think about his choices? Gildo’s father said “No, this is not the first time. He had already been imprisoned in Malange province for 6 months. He was defending the replacement of electricity in the municipality of Calendula. The police always had problems with him. As a family, we support and encourage his activism. He wants the best for Angola”. Q: What happened on the morning of 16 September 2023?  “That Saturday, Gildo was supposed to travel back to Malange. He told me he was going to the market to shop and then he would travel. At the end of the afternoon, I started to see on social media that he had been arrested, but I didn’t believe it because he hadn’t said he was going to the demonstration, I thought it was a lie.” Marcelina said. “When I called him, the guard said that he was in fact arrested, but I only believed it when Gildo called me personally to confirm. I cried a lot. I had a hard time believing it. I had never been to jail before in my life, but since all this started, I had to come to Luanda and now I go to jail often to visit him and also take food.” Q: What has it been like visiting Gildo in jail? Marcelina responds first, “The first time I went to visit my partner, I cried a lot. It was hard to believe he was there. Once, I asked him if he would continue his activism after leaving prison, he said yes. Activism is his life. I know his dream is to defend Angola so I will continue supporting him. I miss talking to him and seeing him happy, because he’s not happy there.” “Gildo is really cool with me. There are days when I’m on the phone, looking at photos and I start crying because I miss my brother so much” says Victor. [Gildo’s father] “My son’s arrest is unfair, he was just defending the rights of motorcycle taxi drivers. Now that Gildo is in prison, his mother is also suffering a lot. She is physically disabled and walks with crutches, Gildo was the one who took care of her, but now, she is on her own. Gildo’s daughters also know that their father is in prison and we always say that their father will be back soon.” “Gildo and other activists have the right to speak and defend constitutionally enshrined rights. Everywhere in the world there are people doing the same things. Even here in Angola, our heroes fought, as did our great Njinga Mbande.” “The activists are only defending the people, but it seems that the government does not want their best interests. The president [and his government] must release Gildo and other prisoners. The hardest moment for me is seeing my son behind bars, he should be with his family, not in jail.” In the first weeks of his arbitrary detention, Gildo was ill, but recovered. He recently relapsed. He had fevers and body aches for more than a month. The lawyers asked the prison authorities for a medical appointment and the diagnosis was a spinal deviation. Gildo cannot stand for more than 30 minutes and now uses a wheelchair. Although he is taking medication, it will only be known in the coming months whether the treatment will be effective or not. Just like Gildo, many other young people are seeing their future jeopardised because they dared to raise their voices to defend the rights of their communities.

0,Reprioritising Resources for the Future of South Sudan,AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2024/08/reprioritising-resources-for-the-future-of-south-sudan/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? Debt and development struggles South Sudan has a total debt burden of 51.2% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The debt is owed mostly to external creditors at 34.8% of GDP, the commercial creditors at 15% of GDP, followed by multilateral creditors (as classified by the International Monetary Fund or IMF) at 14.7% of GDP, and then bilateral creditors at 5% of GDP. Domestic debt, or debt that is raised in the domestic financial market, is 32.1% of GDP. The IMF does not consider this total debt to GDP ratio to be unsustainable, but it does consider South Sudan at high risk of overall debt distress. Data by the IMF show this high risk of overall debt distress as linked to potential volatility in future revenue from oil sales, which currently make up 80% of South Sudan’s GDP. Noteworthy is the prevalence of prepaid oil for debt-borrowing models which have further undermined the potential revenue earnings from oil. Debt repayment continues to take up a significant portion of South Sudan’s budget. For instance, in the 2023/2024 Budget cycle, debt servicing accounted for 13% of overall expenditure. This was more than allocations to education in the same financial year. Although the percentage of the budget allocated for debt repayment is lower than some countries in the region (such as Eritrea at 33.4%) , the country continues to face multiple lawsuits from creditors over debt default. According to Transparency International, South Sudan ranks 177 out of 180 countries in the Corruption Perception Index (where 180 is the most corrupt country). South Sudan also ranks almost last in the Human Development Index – a broad measure of development including income, education and health – at 191 out of 193 countries. This low ranking reflects the severe human rights and developmental challenges faced by the nation. Out of a population of 12 million, an estimated 80% live below the absolute poverty line. Around 90% of the approximately 6.5 million children under 18 years in South Sudan are growing up in households struggling to survive and experience multidimensional poverty and 7.1 million experience acute hunger.   Addressing these challenges is further complicated by a significant portion of South Sudan’s resources being lost to illicit financial flows (IFFs). IFFs are defined by the UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) as money illegally earned, used or transferred. In 2019 there were solidarity protests in Nairobi against the flow of IFFs from South Sudan into Kenya (and Uganda). Reports indicate that South Sudanese government officials, including military personnel, are channelling these illicit funds to private investments in Kenya and Uganda and to finance the conflict. Cumulative losses to IFFs from South Sudan are estimated to have cost USD 8.6 billion or the equivalent of almost 50% of the 2023/2024 budget. Education challenges 70% of children in South Sudan are out of school. This dire situation is exacerbated by systemic deficiencies within the education system itself and overall governance. The UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) notes, for example, that the non-payment of salaries for teachers risks many of them quitting. According to the Ministry of General Education, more than half of all teachers are untrained. It is therefore not surprising that the number of pupils to qualified teachers ranges from 46 to 133 in the 13 states – far more than the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) recommended ratio of 25 students per teacher. Over 2,000 schools do not have access to clean drinking water, 2042 schools are operating under trees, 1134 schools are temporary structures, 848 are semi-permanent and only 1115 schools are permanent. Such statistics risk breaching South Sudan’s minimum core obligations under international human rights law to provide for minimum essential levels of the most basic forms of education let alone acceptable quality highlighting the urgent need for substantial investment and reforms. Yet the 2023/2024 budget allocated only 8% to education, which, while better than health which was at 2%, is well below the Incheon Declaration target of 15-20% of budget and seriously risks undermining South Sudan’s obligations under both the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child to adequately ensure the right to education for all its young people. This is in addition to Article 29 of its Constitution, which guarantees that all levels of government shall provide access to education for all without discrimination. This neglect compromises the right to education, which is crucial for the prospects of its children and consequently the nation’s socio-economic development. The current shortfall in funding perpetuates a cycle of poverty and limits opportunities for young people, undermining their potential to contribute meaningfully to the nation’s rebuilding efforts and thereby risks forfeiting a generation’s ability to drive sustainable growth and stability. The UN Special Rapporteur on Education describes how even during natural disasters and armed conflicts, the right to education should not be interrupted, delayed or even denied. A Sustainable Way Forward Beyond the immediate need to end conflict-related human rights violations and address displacement and continued loss of life, the government urgently needs to tackle corruption and IFFs. If it does this with international cooperation and assistance, it can use these additional resources for spending on public services such as education. It can also begin to implement a just transition away from its dependence on fossil fuel use and revenues. This should happen as close as possible to 2050 in line with South Sudan’s capacity and low responsibility for historical greenhouse gas emissions. In this context, South Sudan needs to make prudent use of its oil revenues in this transition period, to diversify its economy, expand its tax base and its tax capacity from its current 3.6% of GDP (far below the 15.6% average for African countries) as well as to use these resources to develop equitably. Customs duties, for example, constitute only 20% of tax revenues relative to domestic taxes which make up 80%. Personal Income Tax also contributed 50% to total tax collection showing there is potential to generate more from Corporate Income Taxes. Only through comprehensive fiscal reforms and strategic investments in public goods and services such as education can South Sudan hope to overcome its current challenges and create a foundation for long-term prosperity and stability.

0,Meet the Mexican women searching for their loved ones,AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2024/08/meet-the-mexican-women-searching-for-their-loved-ones/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? Across the Americas, hundreds of thousands of people have gone missing due to past and present armed conflicts, organized crime, and crimes under international law perpetrated by authorities. In Mexico alone, according to official figures, over 116,000 individuals have been disappeared and remain unaccounted for.​ In Mexico, 200 collectives of families searching for the disappeared are estimated. One of them is Hasta Encontrarte, formed in 2021 in the state of Guanajauato. This collective gather 86 families, 99% of their members are women. The collective is dedicated to the tireless work of searching for their loved ones through independent search brigades. Their efforts have resulted in the location of 23 clandestine graves and the discovery of 203 missing persons. In addition to these direct actions, Hasta Encontrarte also engages in advocacy and dialogue with national authorities and international organizations. For its members, the collective not only represents a joint struggle, but also a space of sisterhood where they listen and accompany each other on the path of the search.  Verónica, Karla and Bibiana are spokespersons of Hasta Encontrarte. Following the disappearance of their family members, the lives of Veronica, Karla and Bibiana changed forever. With limited support from the Mexican government, they started searching for their loved ones, first on their own, and then together as part of the Hasta Encontrarte collective. These women they took on the challenging roles that the authorities are supposed to fulfill — leading investigations and digging up bodies in exhausting and dangerous conditions.​ Despite navigating hardships, violence and threats, they have continued to be there for one another. Here, Karla, Veronica and Bibiana share the reality of what it’s like to search for your loved ones — and why the sisterhood is supporting them every step of the way. Karla is looking for her brother, Juan Valentín Martínez Jiménez, who went missing on 18 February 2020. She spent a year searching for him with Mexico’s State Search Commission. Karla quickly learnt where to search and how to identify areas where bodies might be found. Although an investigation file into my brother’s disappearance has been open for four years, nobody will look for him unless I do. When I reported my brother missing, the authorities asked, “What did your brother do?” I was afraid to answer because I didn’t know if it would stop them from looking for him. I felt my situation would be misjudged if my brother had tattoos, smoked or drank.  Mexico’s State Search Commission stopped searching for my brother after a year, so I decided to do it myself. Together with three women, we went out searching for our loved ones. We didn’t know much about where we were going or why, but we went without fear, and with a desire to find them. That’s when we started to find our relatives. The first time I pulled out a foot I was vomiting. The smell was strong. I thought I had to stay there for hours. I tried to familiarize myself with the smell, until I was no longer disgusted. Now finding and smelling a body doesn’t feel disgusting. It makes me feel as though we’ve done a good job and we have accomplished our goal. Since I started searching, I have changed – I can’t smile, I find myself in a bad mood. I can’t live like that… If I stay home, I will feel sad. I am happiest in the field searching for those who have been disappeared. I want to find them — and I want to do it with dignity. But I still find every search traumatic. When I get home, I take a bath, I close my eyes and I can’t stop seeing those images. These are things that mark you. I have lost a lot of weight due to stress and anxiety. Searching for someone is dangerous. I have been chased and shot at. It’s terrifying to feel that the same people who took my brother could come for me too. I feel completely insecure and vulnerable wherever I am. Although the authorities sometimes give me protection measures, I am aware that the authorities do not often recognize our work as human rights defenders, and that the measures are not sufficient for the risk we face and to guarantee our lives. Threats continue to persist. At this point, though, I just want to find my brother.I have gone to workshops, organized my time and searched as much as I can. We have found 216 people, but my brother is not among them. I’m working, but I don’t have a result for me. I am happy for the 216 families who are resting, but it makes me angry to say, what about me? I am grateful to be part of Hasta Encontrarte. There is a kind of sisterhood among all of us which lifts me up when I feel down. Bibiana is looking for her brother, Manuel Ojeda Negrete, who went missing on 8 January 2018. She has been threatened numerous times, but through the collective, she has found the power to carry on searching. My brother disappeared in 2018. I started searching for him afew days afterwards, while I was pregnant. That’s when I realized that a threat to me was also a threat to my unborn child, as well as to the future of my other son. After I started my search, I received threats, so I would visit the Prosecutor’s Office [to ask for protection]. It was there I met other women searching for their disappeared loves ones. Becoming part of a collective in Mexican society feels revolutionary. If something happens to us that feels wrong, we seek to change things in our own way.    In 2020, we marched against the election of a new Head for the State Search Commission — a choice that was made without consulting us. We took to the streets and protested, despite the dangers we faced. The collective, for me, is like finally being able to see, and every memory I have of the community is an act of bravery. I am grateful for this collective, because since I started my search, I have become stigmatized by the community. A neighbor asked our sons to stop playing together, while my circle of friends has reduced. I have received many threats for searching for my brother too. I was summoned by the public prosecutor’s office and asked for my telephone number. I was subsequently harassed by agents of the criminal police, with photos, calls, messages and so on. Every time I hang up the phone, I fear someone is going to come and wake me up in my house… every time a car comes to my house at night, I feel it is the last second of my life. I have requested protection from the Mechanism for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders and Journalists, but I have only received a panic button which has not worked for a long time.  With every giant step we take, we see a new abyss and how nothing is enough to stop the disappearances from happening. Wanting to find my brother alive is my way of rebelling, of not accepting the discourse. It’s another way to defend my brother’s dignity. Veronica is searching for her son, Iván Arturo Silva Durán, who went missing on 24 November 2019. She has been detained, lost her job and now suffers from anxiety and depression. However, the desire to find her son still burns bright. When I filed the complaint about my son’s disappearance, the authorities asked: “What was your son doing? Was he partying? We should wait 72 hours.” I insisted a complaint was filed as I knew my son had been taken away in some vans. Initially, [the authorities] would not let me look for him, they would not let me do anything. A year later, I went to the Prosecutor’s Office and I read the investigation file. I realized that they were not looking for my son… I was very angry. I had lost a year of searching, when they could have found him.  Once my sister gave me her car, I started searching for him every day. But I felt the absence of my whole family. I felt alone, but I had to keep looking for him. I was invited to be part of the collective very quickly. Together, we protested the appointment of the head of the State Search Commission. Unfortunately, the protest was met with violence and I was one of four women detained. When we were detained, I felt a mixture of courage and fear, but even more, a lot of pain, because a policeman took my son’s photo from me and trampled on it. I didn’t know where it went. It hurt me a lot, because it was not worth it. We weren’t hurting anyone. All we wanted was justice in some way. We wanted help searching for our relatives. After I was detained, my employer gave me an ultimatum: stop searching for my son or quit my job. I refused to stop searching for him and 10 days later, my boss told me I wasn’t needed. After I was fired, things fell apart. I couldn’t afford gasoline for my car. I couldn’t search for my son. For almost a year and a half, I went without electricity, water, sometimes without food. It was a hard year. I didn’t want to say to people, ‘I don’t have [money], I’m hungry, I don’t have gas.’ Nowadays, I have anxiety. I feel as though I have depression. I have high blood pressure and I am exhausted. I feel so much anguish and pain. It is a slow agony I am living I no longer have the hope of finding my son alive, but I want to find him. I hope that before God takes me, I can return him to a Christian burial place. I want him to know I never stopped searching for him and that I love him with all my heart. The case of the collective Hasta Encontrarte is an example of the experience of thousands of women searchers in the Americas. In the continent, the role of women in guaranteeing the rights of the disappeared has been crucial and inspiring. Their leading role can be observed from Canada to Patagonia. However, the search is fraught with risks, attacks and human rights violations. In recognition of the tireless struggle undertaken by women searchers in the Americas, Amnesty International joins in solidarity and action to the demands for justice through its #SearchWithoutFear campaign. As part of this campaign, Amnesty International also publishes the report Searching Without Fear: International Standards for the Protection of Women Searchers in the Americas. This document outlines the main risks faced by women searchers and the obligations of States to ensure an enabling and safe environment for them, including guaranteeing their protection and dignified life.

On 1 August, Equatorial Guinean human rights defender Joaquín Elo Ayeto was arrested at his house in Malabo, Equatorial Guinea’s capital, when members of the Gendarmerie forcibly entered his house and took him away. He was accused of carrying out illegal activities through the civil society platform, Somos +, which he is a member of and which the authorities claim is not legally registered. He was initially sent to Malabo Black Beach prison before being transferred on 13 August to Oveng Azem prison, in the eastern city of Mongomo, where he is held in pretrial detention.

Part 2 in the #FreeTheFive Blog Series  On the morning of 16 September 2023, activists (A) Adolfo Campos, (G) Hermenegildo José Victor AKA Gildo das Ruas, (P) Abraão Pedro dos Santos AKA Pensador and (T) Gilson Moreira AKA Tanaice Neutro left their homes to join a solidarity protest with motorcycle taxi drivers who were facing restrictions on their activities in Luanda, capital of Angola.  They believed, the restrictions would negatively impact young people, leading to unemployment and poverty. The demonstration had been duly communicated to the authorities. Hours before the beginning of the protest, some protesters arrived at the assembly point, and while waiting for others, they were surprised with the arrival of the police on site, carrying out arrests. As a form of non-resistance, the protesters lay down on the ground, but that’s not what police wanted, they were forced to get into the police car, to the police station.   19 September 2023, four days later, Adolfo, Gildo, Pensador and Tanaice Neutro found out that they would not return home before serving a sentence of twoyearsand five months in prison for disobedience, even though there was no evidence presented in court.  According to the lawyer in the case, before leaving the courtroom, the judge in the case only sentenced Adolfo, Gildo and Tanaice Neutro. Moments later, the clerk returned to the courtroom to read the minutes, and it was at that moment that Pensador (29 years old) found out that he had also been convicted.  Pensador was scheduled to get married in November 2023. That day, his partner saw her dream postponed, and although she tried to understand why her fiancé was being sentenced, she couldn’t get any answers. Tanaice Neutro (36) had just been released from a prison sentence of one year and six months for calling the president a clown. 18 months in prison were not enough to stop him from fighting against social injustice and for the right to protest, and it was with this conviction that Tanaice returned to the streets supporting other people in their struggles, little did he know that in three months he would return to prison to serve another sentence for a crime he didn’t commit. If Tanaice stays until the end of his current sentence, he will spend almost four years in prison simply  for peacefully exercising his human rights.On 15September Tanice will celebrate his birthday, but will spend it in prison, this year, far from his family and friends.  Adolfo (44) was working as a bureau chief at a local newspaper. Since he was arrested, his wife has been responsible for the education of their four minor children alone. When she is not looking for ways to support her children, she is driving for two hours a day to drop off food at the jail and looking for ways for the authorities to allow her husband’s treatment. Adolfo was diagnosed with pneumonia and needs urgent surgery according to his doctors. So far the authorities refuse to allow Adolfo to undergo surgery. Father of two young daughters, Gildo (28) loves studying politics. He dedicated his time to taking care of his mother who is living with a disability and relied on her son for her daily activities. Since the day Gildo left home to participate in the demonstration, he never saw his children again. That wasn’t the first demonstration he had participated in, but it was the first time he felt the intolerance of authorities that fail to facilitate peaceful protests. Every week friends and family visit him and all they wish is to see Gildo out of prison as soon as possible so he can get his normal life back. End the crackdown on human rights!   This is not the first case of activists being arrested and summarily sentenced simply for exercising their human rights and without having committed any crime in Angola. Angolan authorities must uphold and ensure the human rights of everyone in the country including  the rights of protesters. Angolan authorities must stop seeing activists and human rights defenders as a threat to the government when the only thing they do is exercise their human rights. We recently launched a major campaign for the release of the 4 activists. We met the families of the four prisoners who shared how this one year has looked like without their beloved ones. Each week we will highlight in a blog, one of the four cases. Stay tuned to our social media. If you want to see them free immediately, join the campaign by signing this petition and sharing it now.

In August 2017, the Myanmar security forces undertook a brutal campaign of ethnic cleansing against Rohingya Muslims. Hundreds of thousands fled across the border to seek refuge in Bangladesh. In a 2022 report, Amnesty International alleged that Facebook owner Meta substantially contributed to the atrocities suffered by Rohingya people by proactively amplifying harmful anti-Rohingya content in Myanmar in 2017. Umme Salma, a Rohingya activist —  a 13-year-old schoolgirl in 2017— was among them. She lived in Kutupalong refugee camp in southern Bangladesh, where she actively advocated for the Rohingya’s right to education. Now, the 20-year-old is studying International Development at Fanshawe College in Canada.  Meta is currently facing at least three active requests seeking remediation for the Rohingya. Refugee groups in Cox’s Bazar have also made direct requests to Meta to remediate them by funding a USD $1 million education project in the refugee camps. Following Meta’s alleged failure to provide any effective remedy and refusing the community’s request to fund children schools in the camps, a group of Rohingya refugees, including Umme, filed a complaint against the company under the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises via the Irish National Contact Point (NCP), with the help of Victim Advocates International (VAI). As Meta is domiciled in the United States, the complaint was transferred to the US NCP in June 2022. Since September 2022, the complaint has continued to remain under consideration. Amnesty International is a partner of VAI, supporting Rohingya community groups in their pursuit of justice. In this essay published to mark the seven-year anniversary of the violence against the Rohingya, Umme talks about growing up in a refugee camp and argues that Meta should provide resources for their education as part of redress efforts. In 2017, I fled the conflict in Myanmar at the age of 13 and lived in Kutupalong camp in Bangladesh for nearly six years. Life was difficult for us. We didn’t have enough income. We didn’t have enough space for eight family members. Only two rooms and one kitchen. The World Food Programme (WFP) provided food rations, but it was not enough. When I was living in the refugee camp, I started an organization called Literature and Handicap for Rohingya Women to help educate women and girls. To help them learn to read and write. To know about human rights, about justice and gender-based violence. I wanted them to get a source of income.  To help them earn money to meet their basic needs. I also used to provide embroidery training and sewing machine training and capacity building training for the women. I just said to myself, ‘I must do something’. That’s how I started the organization. I also have a passion for photography. I use it to tell others about the plight of the Rohingya. I want the international community to see what’s inside the refugee camps. Since my childhood, I have always wanted to be a journalist. I didn’t follow my dream, but I am following my passion [photography] and at the same time I’m sharing the challenges and the suffering of the Rohingya people in the camps. This is important for me because people around the world don’t know the Rohingya, they don’t know our culture and they don’t know our challenges. The world should know we have a rich culture and language. It’s time to educate others about our reality. There is no formal education in the Rohingya camps. My own younger brother and my siblings became uneducated because they did not get a chance to go to school there. No access to education is another way of indirectly killing a generation.  Everyone should get a chance to be educated and to show their talent but there’s nothing.  When you are educated, you can distinguish between right and wrong. You can see the real world. You can understand what is happening. In 2017, we suffered a lot in Myanmar from [digital] content that incited violence, hatred and discrimination against the Rohingya.   They could have stopped this from happening on Facebook. They are the ones who handle their social media, and everything going through their platform. If they wanted to, they could have stopped it, they could have raised their voices against the injustice the Rohingya people are going through. People from Myanmar were spreading hate speech against the Rohingya people in 2017, but Meta was silent. They have a responsibility to the people who suffered in 2017. Sadly, they did not do enough. I am an eyewitness to what was happening when they allowed hate speech against my community. I am asking Meta why they are allowing injustice to prevail by failing to provide adequate redress, why they are not assisting the suffering Rohingya people. At the very least, they should provide a fund for the education of Rohingya refugees, as we asked for as a part of a redress effort. The situation is becoming worse day-by-day for the Rohingya people living in refugee camps in Bangladesh. The food rations are low. Medical supplies are running out quickly because of many diseases in the camps. The situation in Myanmar is also getting worse and the people living in the camps in Bangladesh are worried about people there. The Myanmar government is killing people every day, but the world is not saying anything. It is taking its time to solve the Rohingya crisis, but what is stopping them from educating the Rohingya children who are in the Rohingya camps? People will suffer more from this situation. I don’t know how much more they will suffer but people are struggling and losing hope and they don’t have a strong feeling that tomorrow will be any better and that tomorrow they will be alive. In 2017, the world said we didn’t know enough about the discrimination you are facing from the Myanmar government. Now, the world knows everything about the current situation in Maungdaw and Buthidaung areas of Rakhine State. Rohingya people are being killed by the Arakan Army, an armed group that claims to be fighting on behalf of ethnic Rakhine people. The remaining people are crying out for protection from the international community, while the Arakan Army has denied the allegations and the world is silent. It is like a movie that the world is watching. An action movie that is not reality. It’s like people are watching but not seeing what is actually happening. The Myanmar government is killing people every day and refugees in Bangladesh continue to suffer, but the world is not saying anything. It is time we get some redress to at least help us build a better future, which could start with children in Rohingya camps having adequate access to education.

In the nineties, Shell was determined to make a profit from its operations in the Niger Delta – and no one could stand in its way. The company* urged Nigeria’s military government to deal with environmental protests – knowing full well what that could mean. The military killed and tortured people in a brutal crackdown that culminated in the 1995 sham trial and hanging of nine Nigerian men, including Esther Kiobel’s husband, Dr Barinem Kiobel. Amidst the devastation, Esther Kiobel, 59, found the strength to take care of her children as well as take on Shell and the Nigerian Government. In 2022, a Dutch court ruled that there was insufficient evidence to prove that Shell had been involved in her husband’s death. Having spent close to 30 years battling the huge oil conglomerate in court, Esther is still seeking justice for her husband – and she won’t stop until his name is cleared. “My husband, Dr Barinem Kiobel, was executed in November 1995. He was an innocent man, but he died as a criminal. He died because he dared stand up to Shell and the Nigerian Government, using his voice for those who couldn’t. Our life in Ogoniland, Nigeria, used to be great. People lived happily; fishing and farming our livelihood. But after Shell came to mine oil, they destroyed our land and polluted our rivers. We tried to speak out, but Shell, together with the Nigerian Government, didn’t want us to have a voice. My husband, a government official at the time, was horrified by what was happening to Ogoniland so he wrote to the Government, explaining the devastation his village was facing. My husband’s activism eventually led to his imprisonment, where he was jailed along with eight other people. The authorities did not even tell my husband why he’d been locked up, just that he was there for his own for safety. No one thought his life was in danger at that point, that people wanted to kill him – he worked for the government. While he was in prison, life was brutal, and my children and I faced constant abuse. I would take food for my husband three times a day as we were afraid the prison food had been poisoned. On one occasion, an army officer saw me. He stopped his vehicle and offered to take me to my husband. Instead, he took me to his office, where he tried to take advantage of me. When he tried to do it again, I pushed him away, and shouted “no”. After I fought him off, a solider tied me up, threw me into a van and told me he knew 200 ways to kill a person – and that he’d use one on me. I was locked up and while I was away, my 11-year-old daughter had to fetch the food and water. As soon as she was close to the prison, soldiers would throw the water on the floor. When my husband found out what was happening, he went on hunger strike, and I was released. Soon after his trial had taken place, I started taking food for him again. One day, on my way to my husband, a soldier stopped me. He said, “They’ve taken him this way.” He directed me to a prison yard. As we approached the yard, the military gave me a sign. My friend knew what it meant and turned to me and said, “They have killed them.” I collapsed and screamed. I didn’t expect the Nigerian government to kill my husband like that. They didn’t even send for me before his execution. When I eventually went to the prison yard, all he had with him was a comb in his hair and the bible. Before he faced the gallows, his last message was: “Tell my wife I love her.” Before my husband faced the gallows, his last message was: ‘Tell my wife I love her.’ He was executed alongside eight other men – men who didn’t want Shell to destroy their land. After killing my husband, they acidized him and shoved him to a burial ground along with the others. He was a learned man. A man with a PhD. I still remember the last time I saw my husband alive. He told me about a recent dream where he tried to hold me close, but I pulled away. I was too young to understand what it meant…. After he died, my family and I went to live in a refugee camp. It was hard. My children couldn’t go to school. It wasn’t safe. However, I was lucky enough to meet Amnesty International at the refugee camp. They gave us hope. They gave us a new life. There are people who do not have a voice and need someone to be there for them. I am glad they were there for me. With the support of Amnesty, my family and I eventually moved to America, where a lawyer contacted me keen to discuss a case against Shell. People had seen what happened and wanted to help me take action. Before Amnesty, I didn’t know about human rights, I didn’t know I could take on a corporate giant like Shell. But with the support of Amnesty and the lawyer, I and eight other widows found the strength to take on the case – and I was the one who would take it to court. My husband was killed like a criminal and all I wanted was for his name to be exonerated – it’s what I still want. My father used to tell me: “A good name is better than gold or silver.” That’s what gave me the strength to fight. It hasn’t been an easy journey – and it’s a fight that’s far from over. During the court proceedings Shell tried to shut me up so many times, but the more they’ve hurt me, the stronger I’ve become. Despite everything, I have forgiven Shell. All I want them to do is clean Ogoniland and put a stop to the fighting. My village is ridden with disease because of pollution. People don’t deserve to live like to that. I want them to make everything right. As for me, I have featured in a documentary called Esther and The Law – it’s an opportunity for me to tell the world my story. People only know part of what happened – but I want the world to know everything that Shell did to my land, my people, my husband and to me. I could have taken Shell’s money, but I said no – because I refuse to stop fighting until my husband’s name is cleared. He was a man that would fight for you – so for me, I just want to prove his innocence. I want his name exonerated.” During the interview, Esther’s daughter Blessing, 42, listened to her mother’s story. She was moved to tears as the memories came flooding back. “I was 11 when my stepfather was killed. I was forced to grow up and take on a role I wasn’t ready for. Hearing my mother talk about her story is devastating and as horrific as it may sound, I know she’s downplaying what happened. Her husband was killed and the only thing that separated them was a fence. My dreams of a good education and a better life were shattered in an instant as I was forced to watch my mother try and come to terms with the death of her husband, while looking after five children in a refugee camp. I am so grateful to Amnesty International – if it wasn’t for this organization, I wouldn’t have a mum. They gave us hope and a new life. And they gave my mother a voice, a platform and the confidence to speak up. Without Amnesty, she wouldn’t have gotten this far in her fight for justice, and she has become so much stronger because of it. My mother moved us to America and started a new job. She is such a strong woman – and that’s given me strength! Despite all she’s been through, she still wants her voice to be heard. She refused to let this situation break her – and it’s incredible to see her grow in strength, inspire thousands around her and encourage people to speak out against injustice. I am so proud of her. I want to say a huge thank you to Amnesty – you have been there for me, my family as well as those who are less privileged. We are alive because of you.”  *Shell denies this allegation.

0,"“With her imprisonment, her dreams have been interrupted.”",AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2024/08/with-her-imprisonment-her-dreams-have-been-interrupted/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? The case of Angolan Tiktoker Ana da Silva (32), AKA Neth Nahara, became internationally known after her conviction on 14 August 2023, in a summary trial, for the crime of “outrage against the state, its symbols and bodies” for recording a live video on TikTok criticizing the president of Angola, on 12 August 2023. Initially, she had been sentenced to 6 months in prison, but her sentence was unconstitutionally extended to two years. This is not the first time someone has been convicted and sentenced for criticizing Angola’s president. Between 2022 and 2023, musician Tanaice Neutro was jailed for 18 months for calling the president a clown. Three months after leaving prison, he was arrested again hours before taking part in a demonstration. The public prosecutor initially accused  Tanaice and other four activists, of “outrage and injury to the President of the Republic” for holding a placard calling President Joao Lourenço “Incompetent.” Amid various inconsistencies and lack of evidence, the charge was changed to “disobedience and resisting orders”. Neth Nahara and others are currently arbitrarily detained  solely for peacefully exercising their human rights. Their cases show the growing intolerance of critical views and crackdown on human rights in Angola. We wanted to understand more about the Angolan woman who dared to criticize the president’s leadership on her Tiktok account. Although she is not the first person to be convicted of the crime of outrage, Neth is the first to be convicted for content posted on Tiktok. To understand more greatly the impact of her arbitrary detention, we spoke to her mother Zeferina Silva (57), affectionately known as Tia Fina (Aunty Fina), who welcomed us into Neth’s home. It was 8 o’clock in the morning, and the fire for cooking was already lit. “Every day it’s like this, I have to get up early and prepare the food to take to jail,” she said, and so we began our conversation. Aunty Fina began by saying that Neth grew up with her until the age of 7, then she went to live with her father, stepmother and other siblings in Luanda, Angola’s capital. Neth made sure she never lost contact with her biological mother. Neth’s favourite food  is funge (made from corn flour) with meat, and sometimes fish. Aunty Fina  recalls that when Neth was a child and watched TV, she would look at the girls with microphones and tell her mother that one day she would be on television too, that she would sing, wear pointed shoes and dance without any shame. “She has always liked helping people since she was a child,” said Auntie Fina, and this reminded us of Neth’s (tiktok) lives in which she denounced the lack of HIV medication and said that she brought her own medication from abroad when she traveled, but she didn’t just bring it for herself, she also brought it for other people who had no way of accessing the medication in Angola’s health services. At that moment, Aunty Fina forgot everything and was thrilled to see that her daughter had achieved most of her dreams. “Neth also liked cars and said that one day she would drive a car, today she does. My daughter has made her dreams come true. But now, with her imprisonment, her dreams have been interrupted. Our lives have changed completely.” Aunty Fina regretted not even having the opportunity to take part in the summary trial of her daughter, who was taken from her home by the Criminal Investigation Services (SIC) on 13 August 2023. “It’s been very difficult to look after the two kids, look after the house, cook every day and still take public transport to jail every day. I can’t take it anymore. My legs hurt and the worst days are rainy days. The whole area around the house is normally flooded and it’s very difficult to get out. I often go back and forth from jail all wet when I’m delivering food, it’s exhausting”. “At first, when the children asked about their mother, I would lie and say that Neth had traveled. But the eldest is now 5 and already understands things. One day he asked why he can’t talk to his mother by video call, if that’s how it usually happened when his mother was travelling. The other day he asked where I take the food every day. I ended up telling the truth. He wasn’t surprised, he saw his mother being taken away by the SIC on 13 August 2023”. “The kids have only seen Neth once, a few months ago when the prison allowed a special visit for all the prisoners. I took the children and Neth was very happy, the children were also very happy to see their mother. Neth needs to come back and look after her children. A grandmother’s care is not the same as a mother’s care.” We also wanted to understand how Neth is doing now. In 2020, she made it public that she is HIV positive. Since her arrest in August 2023, Neth Nahara was not receiving her daily medication for the virus for eightmonths, seriously impacting her health, and putting her life at serious risk. Her health situation was critical, which led to an emergency hospitalization on 3 December 2023. Although she now has access to her medication, Aunty Fina guaranteed that Neth’s health is stable, but her morale is low. “Being in jail is hard. She’s demoralized. We don’t know how this case will end because Neth is not like a regular prisoner, there are political motivations involved and politics isn’t easy in Angola.” “I can’t take it anymore. My body is aching, but there’s nothing I can do, Neth is my daughter. This exercise is very difficult, it’s better to look after a sick person in hospital than a political prisoner in jail because I don’t have time to stay at home for a single day, I always have to take her food and medication”. “It’s been very difficult, including financially. I don’t live in Luanda, I live in another province, but now I’m just here looking after the children and Neth. Neth used to look after herself financially and help me as well. Now, we’re in a very difficult situation even though Neth’s husband helps us whenever he can but is still difficult”. “Even though Neth didn’t finish her bachelors in Law, she knows what she’s talks about, but if anyone was offended by my daughter’s words I apologize, all I want is for Neth to get out of prison because she’s suffering and her children need her, it’s not fair that they’re growing up without their mother, this imprisonment is [being] more challenging for the kids”. “Ana has to be released. There are moments when I’m walking, it feels like I’m not walking. My body feels sore, but I must keep moving. We are one year into this. I need my daughter to be released”. After spending the morning with Aunty Fina and seeing first hand, what her painful journey has been like, made us reflect on many other stories, some unknown, of people who are arbitrarily detained because they dared to use their voices and speak out about the country’s problems. Auntie Fina is being a true heroine. We joined our voices to hers demanding Neth Nahara’s immediate release.

0,Cote d’Ivoire: Protecting the environment and people’s right to health against actions by corporates,AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2024/08/cote-divoire-protecting-the-environment-and-peoples-right-to-health-against-actions-by-corporates/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? On 19 August 2006, the Probo Koala, a cargo ship chartered by the British oil trading company Trafigura, docked at the port of Abdijan with 528 cubic meters of highly toxic waste, with the authorization of Cote d’Ivoire. The chemical waste was then dumped at several sites of the city and its suburbs. Air pollution ensued as a vile stench spread across the city. On the same day, thousands of people trooped to health centres complaining of nausea, headaches, vomiting, rashes and nosebleeds. At least 17 people died immediately and over 100,000 experienced health problems in the weeks, months and years which followed. Environmental experts reported severe groundwater contamination. State authorities carried out some remediation operations but not all polluted sites were decontaminated and people living in certain areas continue to experience health problems to this date. Several cases were brought before the courts in Cote d’Ivoire with regards to this incident. In 2007, Trafigura signed an agreement with the Ivorian government to shield itself from legal action. In the agreement, the government undertook not to initiate or pursue any suit against the company or its representatives in exchange for 95 billion CFA. In the end, just a handful of families were compensated. And very few people involved in the incident were prosecuted and no state official was ever held accountable before a criminal court for their complicity or negligence. In 2016, LIDHO (Ligue ivoirienne des droits de l’Homme), MIDH (Mouvement ivoirien des droits humains) and the FIDH (International Federation for Human Rights), three NGOs acting on behalf of the victims of this environmental catastrophe, brought a complaint to the African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights. They asked the Court to find that the Ivorian government had failed in its obligation to protect human rights in relation to the Probo Koala toxic waste incident.  On 5 September 2023, the Court issued its judgment and found that Cote d’Ivoire had indeed violated the rights to life, to health and to a generally satisfactory environment[1] of all the people affected by the toxic waste dumping. The Judges explained that the protection of the right to life includes States’ duty to prevent and deter risks on the life of people by corporate companies. The Court found that Cote d’Ivoire knew that the cargo aboard the Probo Koala was toxic waste but it failed to ensure that the waste was treated safely, and that once the dumping had happened, it also failed to take all necessary measures to limit the damage caused to human life and to the environment. In addition, the Court found that the State failed to ensure that persons affected by the disaster had full access to quality health care and that it did not demonstrate that it had effectively and promptly cleaned the polluted sites.  Furthermore, the Court concluded that Cote d’Ivoire had violated people’s rights to information and to remedy.[2] It found that while the State did take some measures to inform people about the dangers around the contaminated sites, it however never informed the public of the long-term consequences of the toxic waste, the exact composition of the waste, the number of people who had died in the mid and long term, among other aspects. The Court also found that the signing of an agreement between the State and Trafigura created a regime of impunity. The Court emphasized that on a matter of such magnitude, national authorities had the obligation to investigate the matter and to consider the cases of all victims and award them reparations as necessary, regardless of how many victims brought complaints. The Court thus ordered Cote d’Ivoire to ensure that victims receive medical and psychological assistance within 6 months, to amend its laws within one year to prohibit the import and dumping of hazardous wastes within its territory, and to ensure the responsibility of corporate entities in respect of acts relating to the environment and the handling of toxic waste, as well as to organize training programs for relevant public officials and in universities with a view to raise awareness on the protection of human rights and the environment. The Court also ordered Cote d’Ivoire to conduct a general and updated national census of the victims and to publish a transparent public report on the use of the funds allocated by Trafigura within six months. The Judges also ordered Cote d’Ivoire to initiate a new independent and impartial investigation in order to prosecute the perpetrators responsible for the disaster and to establish a compensation fund for the victims within one year. This case is the first time that the African Court has examined an issue related to the right to a healthy environment. It sets a very important precedent and clarifies that African States will be held accountable for failure to prevent and punish human rights violations committed by corporate companies.  [1] Articles 4, 16 and 24 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights respectively [2] Articles 9 and 7 respectively Every year, our global community comes together to fight injustice and support people whose human rights are under threat.

0,“I was blinded in one eye… but what saved my life was love”,AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2024/07/i-was-blinded-in-one-eye-but-what-saved-my-life-was-love/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? Leidy Cadena, a political science student from Colombia, was demonstrating in central Bogotá on 28 April 2021, when she was shot in the eye with a rubber bullet by a member of the police. Leidy lost an eye in the attack and her case became emblematic across the country. Leidy was the first person in Colombia to lose an eye at the hands of the police during that year’s National Strike. After she was shot, she filed a complaint with the police, she was interviewed about what happened at least 10 times and received threats on social media which eventually forced her to leave her country. Here, the 24-year-old shares the story of what happened to her, how she’s rebuilt her life and why she remains unafraid to protest. I went to my first protest in 2016. It was against the Corridas (bull fighting) in Bogotá. Shortly after the protest, a stop was put to bull fighting in the city. It had worked! Protesting, to me, was so important and I felt like it was my responsibility to participate. It was a way to change things. That’s why I started studying political science. Just before Covid, the police killed Dylan Cruz during a protest. People were angry. When things returned to normal post-pandemic, prices started rising, people didn’t have jobs. There was a big economic crisis in Colombia, and people started taking to the streets again. Where I was living people didn’t have anything to eat. As students, my boyfriend, Sebastián and I, had to pay for education when it should have been free. That’s what pushed us to go and protest in 2021. I remember getting up early on 28 April. I made some Instagram videos, telling people to come and protest with us, then I cycled to my boyfriend’s house and we went out – we didn’t have a clear direction, we just wanted to protest. It was raining, so we met friends and went to Plaza de Bolívar, where people usually congregate. It was busy, so we left our bikes in the park. While we were peacefully demonstrating, singing and chanting, the police started firing tear gas and people started running, I said, ‘Calm down, let’s walk not run.’ At that point, I was close to where I worked – we thought it would be calmer. I just needed to cross a bridge to get there, but the police were throwing tear gas, preventing people from walking across. I said to my friends. ‘Let’s put our hands up and walk across calmly – they won’t attack us.’ But as we were crossing, a police officer started screaming at us and taunting us. I told them we were just walking past. We wanted to go home, but we had to get our bikes. A police officer told us it was too dangerous to get back to our bikes – so it would be best to go around the neighbourhood. That’s when I was assaulted. I stopped for just a moment, together with Sebastián, my friends Camilo and Karina, a Chilean war journalist who was documenting the protest. One of Sebastián’s friends tried to ask if we could exit the street and the police started saying horrible things. He tried to walk away, but they grabbed him and hit him.  The police officer rudely told us, ‘You shouldn’t be here.’ I was close to him and told him, ‘We haven’t done anything.’ Then boom, everything went black. I put my hands to my face and felt something wet. I started screaming for Sebastian. He arrived and grabbed my arms. I couldn’t see anything. He told me to stay calm, everything would be ok. But I had a feeling my eye had popped out. I took my mobile phone and took a photo, but in that moment I couldn’t see anything. Sebastián let me go and left. I later learnt he had gone to get the identification number of the police officer who had assaulted me – it was important to identify him. While I was in the ambulance, I could feel Sebastián’s nerves. He could see how bad my injury was. I knew I was blind in one eye. I tried to remain calm. Sebastián told me we were going to the doctor and that I’d be fine. When we arrived at the hospital, the doctor told me my eye had exploded, because I was hit directly in the eye with a blunt object. My first phone call was to my mother, to tell her what happened. While I was in the hospital, my friends were calling me to tell me that people who had attended the protests were being disappeared. They told me to go public with what had happened to me. So I went live on a page called Primera Linea Col . I said that a police officer had assaulted me and told my story. The live was shared by lots of people, including influencers and actors, including Julián Román. Around 2am, five million people were sharing what I had posted. During that time, my Facebook and Instagram account were closed. I tried to communicate with Instagram but no one ever responded. I am lucky it was just my social media platforms that disappeared – not me. After I left hospital, I eventually managed to find a lawyer. The police met me at his office to file my complaint. The police kept trying to interrupt me during my testimony and at one point, they told me to file it as a personal injury, rather than police violence. My lawyer and I both said, ‘No, it’s police violence and abuse of power.’ But they refused to listen to us. After that, I was interviewed about what happened at least 10 times by various police departments. Throughout my recovery, I remained grateful to my family, as well as Sebastián’s. My mum worked nights, but she was worried about me, so she asked Sebastián to come and live with us. However, the neighbour started noticing different cars outside my house. I tried not to let it affect me, but eventually I went to stay with Sebastián. Soon after, my mum called me crying. A powdered substance had been posted through the door. It started burning the carpet while my family were at home. That’s when I realized I had to leave Colombia. I contacted Amnesty International and told them everything. I didn’t have a passport, so they helped me get one. Then I sold my things and left for Norway, with Sebastián and my mother. When I arrived in Norway I was detained in a detention facility, but Amnesty was there to support me and help me communicate. After two years away, I finally feel comfortable in Norway – I can see some of the possibilities of being outside of Colombia. I can speak freely and get involved with activism. I am learning Norwegian and I work part time in a Kindergarten, which I love.  In the beginning I wanted to be back home and change things for the better. But I can see my life is in Norway now – that’s why I decided to bring my cats over. I am learning the language and I have accepted for safety reasons that this is the best place for me. Even though we are alone in this city, I am starting to find happiness in small things – my cats make me happy, I can travel and see new things. I recently met my niece for the first time – so to be able to see her and witness her take her first steps has motivated me to create a better world for her. As for Colombia, there aren’t as many protests at the moment. There’s a lot of young people in prison, people have been disappeared and to date, more than 100 people have suffered eye injuries. People are scared to protest, but I know they’re focused on achieving justice and holding the government to account. Likewise, governments in countries such as the USA and Brazil who are allowing sales of these so-called less lethal weapons to the Colombian security forces must be held accountable too. Placing these weapons in the hands of abusive security forces puts people at risk of being tortured and maimed – like I was. Despite my injury, I am still passionate about activism. Protesting is the strongest way to come together and show the world that you don’t agree with something. It is our right to go out on the street and take over the public space and say, ‘I am not OK with that.’ I don’t have any hatred for anyone. Afterall, what saved my life is love. Love from the people around me. That’s something I want to see more of. Everyone makes mistakes, but if we can come together as communities and respect and love each other, the world can be a better place.  *This story was originally published in El Diario.

0,People seeking asylum detained in EU-funded “pilot” refugee camp on Samos,AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2024/07/people-seeking-asylum-detained-in-samos-camp-in-greece/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? In a remote area on the Greek island of Samos lies a highly securitized facility surrounded by barbed wire metal fencing and lined with white containers.  This is the “Closed Controlled Access Centre”, an EU funded refugee camp hosting people, mostly from Middle Eastern and African countries, who are seeking asylum in Greece.  Since 2020, the European Commission has supported Greece in setting up “Closed Controlled Access Centres”, which were designed to replace the former “hotspots” for people seeking asylum on the Aegean islands, where inadequate conditions often prevailed. The EU promised these centres would be “futureproof facilities that would be up to EU standards” and guarantee “better living conditions”. Instead, during a visit in December 2023, Amnesty International found a “dystopian nightmare”: a highly securitized camp lacking in the most basic infrastructure and services, where, under the pretext of conducting identification procedures, the authorities systematically subject people seeking asylum to unlawful and arbitrary detention. Amnesty International’s research highlights the concerning human rights situation in the Samos “Closed Controlled Access Centre”, focusing on the period between July 2023 and January 2024, when increased arrivals led to overcrowding and situations of inadequate conditions and exacerbated residents’ already deficient access to basic services, including water and healthcare. The research documents how, through the so-called “restrictions of freedom” orders imposed by the authorities to new arrivals, residents are systematically subjected to unlawful and arbitrary detention. The research was conducted between December 2023 and June 2024, and is based on meetings and interviews with residents, representatives of the Greek authorities, civil society organizations and UN agencies. After fires devastated the Moria refugee camp on the Greek island of Lesvos in 2020, the European Commission provided €276 million of EU funds for five new “multi-purpose” centres comprising of reception and pre-return detention facilities on the Aegean islands. The “Closed Controlled Access Centre” on Samos was the first to be opened in 2021 and is located in an isolated area on the outskirts of the main city, Vathi, where most of the civil infrastructure, services and civil society organizations are based. The centre operates a rigid system of restrictions and surveillance, including double barbed wire metal fencing, CCTV surveillance, digital and physical security infrastructures, and the 24/7 presence of patrolling police and privately contracted security officers. In April 2024, the Greek Data Protection Authority fined the Greek authorities for the use of security systems, also operated in the Samos centre, due to breaches of data protection legislation. Security cameras and barbed wire scale the centre creating a ‘prison-like environment’. People did not have enough water or adequate healthcare, and, in some cases, even beds. All the while being unable to leave the centre for weeks, sometimes months on end. As a result of increased arrivals from July 2023, the Samos centre experienced overcrowding between September and January 2024, reaching a peak of 4,850 residents in September 2023. The site’s original capacity was for 2,040 people, but the authorities changed it to 3,650 in September 2023. This change was made without any apparent measures taken to increase accommodation.   This led to some people being housed in non-residential areas and containers, in inadequate conditions, and exacerbated long-standing issues in the provision of basic services, including water shortages and the lack of a permanent medical doctor. The living conditions of residents, especially during times of overcrowding in the centre, may have amounted to inhumane and degrading conditions, in breach of the prohibition of ill-treatment.  Since February 2024, the number of the residents decreased, and the population has since been within capacity. However, serious shortcomings in the living conditions of residents, including in the provision of medical services and running water, persist. Residents are systematically subjected to“restrictions of freedom” orders, which confine them to the centre for an initial period of 5 days, which can be – and in practice is overwhelmingly – extended up to 25 days in total from when they arrive. Residents and civil society organizations have said that people are often unable to leave the camp for periods exceeding the 25 days, often without a decision on their “restriction of freedom” being officially taken in their case. On top of the length of these measures, people under “restrictions of freedom” cannot leave the camp, except for “serious health reasons”. These restrictions are routinely applied without an individualized assessment. This goes beyond what can be considered a legitimate restriction of freedom of movement and amounts to unlawful detention. Unaccompanied minors are accommodated separately in a “safe area”, in a fenced-off sub-section of the “Closed Controlled Access Centre”. But they are subjected to heavy restrictions of movements, including a ban on leaving the centre – except to attend school or, more recently, leisure activities under the supervision of child-protection actors – or even the “safe area” to visit the general population spaces.  These restrictions might constitute an undue interference with their right to liberty, security and their freedom of movement and defy international standards which state that the migration-related detention of children is a violation of their rights and should be prohibited.  In May 2024, Amnesty International and ‘Samos Volunteers’, a civil society organization that offers informal education, clothing distributions and psycho-social support to people in refugee and migrant communities on Samos, ran art workshops with people who had lived or were still living in the “Closed Controlled Access Centre” (CCAC). The workshops were attended by people who visit Samos Volunteers’ community centres, as well as people attending the LGBTQI+ support group. Participants were invited to respond to prompts including: “How do you feel living in the Samos camp?”; “What would you like to change in Samos?”; “What do you hope for in the future?”, using art as a form of expression that crosses boundaries of language and culture. The artwork presented in this online exhibition shares personal perspectives, feelings, and experiences of life in the camp. The artworks accompany Amnesty International’s new research briefing ‘Samos: “We feel in prison on the island”: Unlawful detention and sub-standard conditions in an EU-funded refugee centre’. (NOTE: Personal details of the authors of the artwork are included, changed, or wholly omitted depending on their wishes.) We are facing mental health issues. I escaped from the war. We left syria to have a better future […] not [to be] here in unsafe, unclean [conditions], difficult for all reasons. I left my family back home and now i feel punished here. When we arrived in the camp there was water for three hours per day. People couldn’t take showers at the same time. We put water in a jug. We are taking showers as it was done 70 years ago.  Part 1:  My first day in Samos Camp  Everything was nice. Reaching Samos Island after suffering in Turkey and after “seeing” death at sea, we could not believe that we made it alive and well.  They came in an ambulance and with doctors to check if anyone of us got hurt but no one was hurt, thank God. They gave us food and water and gave us some clothes because most of us got wet at sea. There was this girl who was suffering from chills and fever but the doctor gave her paracetamol. She [the doctor] was so nice with us and told us that she had worked in Yemen before. This made me so happy.   Part 2:  They took us in a big car because there was so many of us. More than 20 people. As soon as we arrived in the camp they gave us food and water. The food was nice but we were delayed because of the many questions and the many procedures. We were so tired all we wanted to do is sleep. After the process [registration] finished, we took our blankets and went to a place they call [illegible]. We arrived there but we were surprised that there were no mattresses and we had to sleep on the floor.  It was a problem for some of us but the others were fine. We turned on the air conditioners because it was cold and we slept after a long journey of adventures and hardship…  We suffer from the water problem. It keeps cutting in the toilets most times.  The asylum process keeps getting delayed and we do not know why.  It is unsafe for my kids, they cannot go to the toilet alone, i need to accompany them. Most of the time my children pee themselves because they are afraid to go out at night. (The) water in the bathroom is dirty and discontinuous… my kids got lice in the hair and cockroaches move on them while they sleep. Kids wake up at night and find the cockroaches walking on them and it is traumatic.  Living in Samos camp as a person that is part of the LGBTQ community is very difficult because there is no special place for us to live in the camp…they don’t care about how we are feeling. I have been mocked. Some people hate in the camp because of sexual identity. This makes me feel so sad and depressed. “The presence of refugees remains a testament to their resilience in the face of difficulties, while they face many challenges. They continue to build a new life and better future, refugees need support to alleviate their suffering. They deserve respect, appreciation and the opportunity to build a new life.  Top-left: This is the forest in Turkey when crossing the border. This is the worst part because it ruins your health and mentality. All you think about is to cross the border. You might expect the police, you might even go to prison and face deportation back to your country before you make the crossing.   Bottom-left: This part has different fates – you might make it to Samos or you might be violently pushed back to Turkey. People here can face death in the sea.   Bottom-right: This is the shock. You think you will find a very nice situation, but everything is the opposite. It’s prison. They say this is Europe, this is freedom – but it is not like this.   Top-right: This the dream. This is the good life. Everyone dreams for this moment – to have your own house, your own life, no more troubles, forget your suffering.” This is all related to hope. Each stage you hope for the next stage. And in the end, you hope to have a good life for you and your family. The European Commission’s support for the creation and operation of the Samos centre, and in the other “Closed Controlled Access Centres” on the Greek islands, enhances its responsibilities for any resulting violations. Like all new EU-funded centres, the Samos camp is designed to comply with the principles underpinning the EU’s Migration and Asylum Pact, a set of recently adopted reforms to EU asylum law. Amnesty International has consistently expressed concern that the Pact would weaken access to asylum and increase the risk of human rights violations and de facto detention, notably through the restrictions to peoples’ movements while undergoing the screening, border asylum and border return procedures. The EU must hold Greece accountable for human rights violations in the centre and ensure that model is not a blueprint for members states implementing the new Migration and Asylum Pact. As Tasneem shows us with her artwork, “My Life to Freedom”, hope is not lost.  Greece and the EU still have the opportunity to act to improve living conditions for people awaiting their asylum application decisions and to ensure human rights and basic humane treatment are upheld. * NOTE: Pseudonyms have been assigned to all CCAC residents interviewed.

0,What is happening at the quota-reform protests in Bangladesh?,AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2024/07/what-is-happening-at-the-quota-reform-protests-in-bangladesh/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? On 15 July 2024, students of Dhaka University were sitting with placards and flags in a peaceful protest calling for reforms on the quota allocation for government jobs in Bangladesh.  Suddenly, they were attacked by individuals armed with rods, sticks and clubs with a few even brandishing revolvers. Within hours, a pattern emerged across the country with similar attacks coordinated by people believed to be members of the Bangladesh Chatra League (BCL), a group affiliated with the ruling Awami League (AL), against student protesters. By the afternoon of16 July, police fired tear gas and charged with batons drawn at protesters in front of Begum Rokeya University in the north-western city of Rangpur where students had gathered, led by the protest coordinator Abu Sayed among others. Abu Sayed, a student of English at the Rangpur’s Begum Rokeya University, stood his ground. As the police closed in, he spread his arms wide open, in a moment of defiance. In a seemingly intentional and unjustifiable attack, the police fired directly at his chest. At least two police officers discharged 12-gauge shotguns directly towards him from across the street – a distance of merely 15 meters. Sayed clutched his chest on impact as officers fired at least two more times using birdshot,  ammunition that is designed for hunting which is extremely dangerous, inherently inaccurate and thus unlawful for use in the policing of protests. Sayed posed no apparent physical threat to the police. Sayed’s death certificate states he was ‘brought dead’ to the hospital. He was just 25 years old. The video of Sayed’s brutal killing sparked outrage and became a symbol of the violence directed at protesters in Bangladesh since 15 July 2024. By 18th July, 32 deaths were reported as the authorities continued to attack the protesters. The highest number of deaths reported in a single day was 75 – on 19 July. The Government proposed a discussion, but the protesters rejected it in the face of a mounting death toll. Not only protesters, but journalists and bystanders too were assaulted and killed during the crackdown. Then the entire country went offline when the government imposed a communication blackout, leaving the world to guess what was happening. In the days to follow, the notorious Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), the Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB), and the Army were deployed across the country and a “shoot at sight” curfew was imposed. Five days later, internet restrictions were partially lifted. More than 200 people had been killed in less than 10 days and thousands more injured. Few countries have witnessed such a death toll in such a short duration of time. According to media reports, at least 2,500 people have also been arbitrarily arrested and around 61,000 protesters named as accused persons in cases. Students are protesting in response to the reinstatement of a quota that reserves 30 percent of government jobs for children of independence war veterans (and which they argue favours supporters of the ruling party). This quota was cancelled by the government in response to massive student protests in 2018. Following the filing of a written petition by a group of relatives of the war veterans, the High Court of Bangladesh reinstated the 30% quota system at the end of June. Amidst the protests, curfew and internet shut down, on 21 July, the Supreme Court issued an order to reduce the quota from 30 percent to 5 percent. The protests continue in pockets, with protesters demanding justice and accountability for those who were killed, injured and arrested during the last few weeks.   Authorities resorted to a range of tactics to punitively respond to the student protesters, including the unlawful use of lethal and less-lethal weapons in the policing of protests in Bangladesh, leading to hundreds of deaths. Security forces, including the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), the Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB), as well as the police, have unlawfully used both lethal and less lethal weapons (including 12-gauge shotguns loaded with birdshot, 37/38mm grenade launchers, AK-pattern assault rifles and Chinese type 56-1 assault rifle) and tear gas against protesters as verified by Amnesty International. The authorities are conducting arbitrary arrests and detentions of protesters, activists and members of the public. The authorities have also subjected journalists to violence and disrupted their efforts to report freely and safely. Authorities also issued a blanket ban on protests further restricting the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly.Recent media reports state that security forces have conducted raids and mass arrests targeting students and opposition activists across many neighborhoods. In a virtual press conference, a coordinator of the anti-discrimination student movement alleged that over 3,500 students have been arbitrarily detained across the country.  The authorities imposed a total shutdown of the internet across the country on the 18th of July cutting the country off from the rest of the world. Five days later the internet shutdown was partially lifted in some parts of the country on the 23rd of July. Shutting down the internet was a reckless step during a week of escalating violence and state suppression of human rights – a time when access to reliable information is critical. Blanket shutdowns impact people’s safety, security, mobility and livelihoods while creating instability and panic, further undermining their trust in the authorities.  Further in multiple videos from 18 July, the unconscious body of Shykh Aashhabul Yamin, a student at the Military Institute of Science and Technology, was seen on top of an Armoured Personnel Carrier (APC) driving down the Dhaka-Aricha Highway. In three videos verified by Amnesty International, officers can be seen violently yanking Yamin’s body down off the APC, causing Yamin’s head to hit the pavement as his body fell. Eventually other officers can be seen dragging his body over the road’s median barriers, and eventually driving away leaving Yamin’s body on the road. News reports claim that Yamin died later that day from his injuries. None of the 12 officers visible attempted to provide medical aid to Yamin.  Section 5(c) of the United Nations Basic Principle on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials requires law enforcement officials to ensure that assistance and medical aid are rendered to any injured or affected persons at the earliest possible moment. This incident illustrated the callous disregard for the right to life and the abject failure by law enforcement officials to uphold their obligations under domestic and international human rights law. Since the start of the July 2024 Bangladesh protests, we have consistently documented crimes under international law and other serious human rights violations committed by the Bangladeshi authorities in protest-related crackdowns. So far we have verified and documented:  We won’t stop investigating the crimes committed by the Bangladeshi authorities during, and in the aftermath of, the student uprising and calling for Bangladeshi officials to be held to account. All the above actions are shocking evidence of how Bangladeshi authorities are committing serious human rights violations with impunity.  Bangladeshi authorities have failed to protect and facilitate protest and dissent. They must immediately end their repressive measures which are a deliberate attempt to crush protests and any future dissent. Bangladeshi diaspora throughout the world have come out to demand an end to the repression and high death toll. Some have been arrested, and unjustly sentenced in mass trials, as in the UAE. We must stand in solidarity with protesters and all those who continue to demand justice and accountability, despite the risks. Throughout history, peaceful protest has played a pivotal role in the achievement of many of our rights and freedoms and yet across the world today, repressive laws and policies combined with unjustified practices and abusive use of policing measures are creating a toxic environment that poses a serious threat to peaceful protesters and protests. There are clear parallels in the way authorities are deterring, vilifying, criminalizing and punishing people who peacefully protest in Europe, Americas, Africa and Asia. It’s time for people across the world to come together to protect the protest. Everyone has the right to peacefully protest without fear of losing their lives or losing loved ones.

0,“We are a family” an interview with Stasya and Alina,AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2024/07/we-are-a-family-an-interview-with-stasya-and-alina/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? Stasya and Alina are both LGBTI activists from the Ukrainian frontline city of Kharkiv. Stasya is working for an NGO and Alina is serving in the army. In a symbolic gesture, they got ‘married’ during Kharkiv Pride 2023. It wasn’t a legally recognized marriage. However, what the ceremony lacked in legality, it made up for in hope. The ‘wedding’ was an attempt to visualize and experience their dream: to be married, by law. Stasya: “Having social protection is important. We perform public duties like everyone else, but the state gives us rights selectively. For example, if Alina is admitted to an intensive care unit, I will not have the right to visit her or vice versa.” Alina: “There are also purely practical issues, for example, military personnel are provided with housing, the size of the housing depends on the composition of the family. If you are single, you can count on a small apartment for one person at best. The situation is different for spouses and people with children. Since legally Stasya and I are not recognized as a family, we are automatically deprived of this right. A right I deserve as a military officer.” Stasya: “I would say that more LGBTI people are becoming more open [with their identity in public spaces] in recent years. It started with the COVID pandemic and has continued. For example, I saw two adults come to the LGBTI hub where I worked. This was right after the COVID restrictions eased, and they started visiting quite regularly. “I asked them ‘why?’ and they said that they were tired of hiding, any one of them could die at any moment due to the pandemic, so they decided to be themselves. A lot of people now have a similar motivation – with this war, you don’t know what the future will bring you, so you take as much as you can from your life, especially if it is related to people you love.” Stasya: “After the full-scale invasion, more people started to dig deeper: looking for answers to understand what is happening and becoming more aware of what equality and diversity mean, and how Ukrainian society as a whole can benefit from it. “While soldiers protect our state border, we, with other activists, protect the border of human rights and equality. We have to protect our way of life and our future, and we are doing it together with Alina.” Alina: “Now that the international spotlight is on Ukraine following Russia’s full-scale invasion, I believe it’s time for Ukraine to realize the potential for change amidst the chaos inflicted by the invasion.” Stasya: “We need to walk this path by ourselves, as a society. For now, we are building our own future.” Alina: “We should realize that the potential to change and for a better future lies with the people. According to our Constitution people are the source of power. We, therefore, call on the international community to express solidarity, to walk beside Ukrainian society on our way to a better future, to support civil society organizations, so they would have tools and resources to make the change. But we realize that we are the ones who are responsible for our own future, and we are ready to work hard for it.” Stasya; “What is important is the support, not only to LGBTI people, but to Ukraine in general. We all now work for the same goal – to preserve our country and independence and to rebuild everything that was destroyed. If Ukraine thrives, so will human rights, so will we.” With an understanding of the need for LGBTI equality to become more widely accepted in Ukrainian society, and with LGBTI persons more visible, the authorities have started to take notice of the needs and demands of LGBTI people and their allies. Changes to the law that are currently being discussed in civil society spaces, and by policymakers, propose the legal recognition of registered civil partnerships, that would be available for everyone, including LGBTI couples. Same-sex couples could obtain more rights and more protection than they have now and take one more step towards marital equality.

0,Pride ends with mixed feelings in southern Africa as LGBTI people register wins and setbacks,AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2024/07/pride-ends-with-mixed-feelings-in-southern-africa-as-lgbti-people-register-wins-and-setbacks/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? As we reflect on Pride, a month dedicated to celebrating LGBTI people globally, one cannot help but marvel at all the celebrations that took place all over the world, of LGBTI people embracing who they are with their loved ones. Bold and loud celebrations with beautiful colours dominated the month from Thailand to Namibia. Yet in some countries, the struggle for human rights continues in court rooms, to change laws that effectively demonise our own. Many countries are decriminalizing consensual same-sex relations all over the world-but some are lagging behind.  While we celebrate countries which have decriminalised consensual same-sex sex in southern Africa such as Angola, Botswana, Mozambique, South Africa, and most recently, Namibia; we hoped that those who haven’t, such as Malawi, would follow suit in confirming the unconstitutionality of such laws which infringe on freedom of expression and privacy.   These countries cannot continue to hide behind religion and spread the sentiments that citizens support the laws that infringe on fellow citizens’ rights. The laws and government officials’ sentiments against same-sex relations exacerbate the hate and violence against LGBTI people as people tend be influenced by leadership sentiments and depend on the ‘law’ to make their own determination of what is right and wrong. Unfortunately, in this instance it’s not the kind of leadership to be proud of. Malawi’s decision to uphold the criminalisation of consensual same-sex conduct was a blow to LGBTI people not only in Malawi but in the southern African region where most countries have decriminalised these discriminatory laws. In February 2022, a Malawian trans woman, Jana Gonani challenged the constitutionality of some sections of the penal code. Jana was convicted under sections 153 ,318 and 319 of the country’s penal code for committing ‘unnatural offences’ and sexual intercourse by “false pretence”. Jana was subjected to genital examination by a male police officer and is serving an eight-year jail sentence in a men’s prison. The members and staff of LGBTI organisation, were threatened and harassed after they supported Jana in her legal challenge and religious leaders led marches against ‘legalisation of same-sex marriages’.  Anti-LGBTI sentiments, hate and misinformation spread on social media with some saying “homosexuality is un-African” and accusing LGBTI people of being paid. Such sentiments contribute to a climate of impunity for crimes and abuse committed against LGBTI people by the state and non-state actors. Consensual same-sex relations have been politicised in Zambia with political leaders and other influential people weaponizing LGBTI issues against the ruling party and accusing it of “promoting gay and lesbian rights”. This resulted in President Hichilema saying, “We said in opposition and now in government that we do not support gay and lesbian rights as a country,” calling Zambia “a Christian country according to the constitution”. The constitution of Zambia protects the right to freedom of expression and association; and although it is not explicit on gender or sexual orientation, article 23 concerning the fundamental human rights provides for protection from discrimination. Anti-LGBTI rights sentiments have also been on the rise in Zambia and worsened on 17 May 2022- International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia and Transphobia- when the Swedish and Finnish Embassies hoisted the Pride Flag alongside their national flags in support of LGBTI rights, which resulted in backlash from government and the public. In March 2023, a Women’s March in Lusaka organized by Sistah Sistah Foundation against sexual and gender-based violence sparked anti-LGBTI outrage on X (formerly Twitter) after LGBTI people joined the march with rainbow flags. This led to religious leaders, politicians and some in the general public tweeting disinformation regarding the march and alleging it promoted LGBTI people. The government released a statement condemning the march and distancing itself from LGBTI people and groups. The organisers received death threats and were also arrested and released the next day. In May, Isaac Mwanza, a governance activist, and the Zambian Civil Liberties Union (ZCLU), a non-profit organization promoting human rights, approached the Constitutional Court with a case that seeks to decriminalize consensual same-sex conduct in Zambia. We hope that the judiciary would follow the progressive trends of other African courts who have affirmed that human rights apply to all persons equally, including LGBTI people. The continued criminalization of consensual same-sex relations and the negative sentiments of political and religious figures not only risk the lives of LGBTI people but put barriers to accessing their economic, social and cultural rights, especially the right to health. For example, some LGBTI people say they are mocked and verbally abused by health professionals in public hospitals and are sometimes blamed for their ailment which they say is a consequence of their ‘sinful acts’. This discriminatory treatment discourages LGBTI people from seeking healthcare or forces them to conceal their identity in order to access adequate healthcare. There have also been reports of LGBTI people being subjected to forced anal examinations, which domestic courts in the African region have confirmed that it amounts to torture and other ill-treatment. Furthermore, anal examinations violate the UN Convention against Torture, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the African Convention on Human and Peoples’ Rights. The UN Committee against Torture has emphasized that they “have no medical justification and cannot be consented to fully.” While both the Zambia and Malawi constitutions protect the right to non-discrimination and other human rights, these protections are not equally applied to LGBTI people. These countries’ penal codes continue to criminalise consensual same sex conduct in violation of the human rights of LGBTI people. Both countries are state party to international and regional human rights treaties including the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights (African Charter), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) which protect the rights of LGBTI people. Like several other countries in Southern Africa who have affirmed the human rights of LGBTI people, Malawi and Zambia must fulfil their obligations to respect human rights of all persons including the rights of LGBTI people. They must take steps to align their national laws to their regional and international human rights obligations. This includes decriminalizing consensual same-sex conduct and immediately and unconditionally release all who have been convicted under these offences. Additionally, these governments must ensure that LGBTI people and their organizations are able to freely exercise their rights to freedom of expression and association.

0,All eyes on proposed AU probe in Sudan,AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2024/07/all-eyes-on-proposed-au-probe-in-sudan/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? by Dr. Japhet Biegon The ongoing battle between the Rapid Support Forces and the Sudan Armed Forces and their allies for the city of El Fasher marks a significant escalation in Sudan’s 14-month conflict.  Once a haven for hundreds of thousands of people fleeing other parts of Darfur, El Fasher is now a war zone that the UN has described as “hell on Earth”. Atrocities by the warring parties include the shelling of residential areas, bombing of hospitals and attacks on food convoys, amid a dire humanitarian crisis. In response, the African Union (AU) has proposed its strongest action since the conflict began in April last year.  In a 21 May communiqué, the AU Peace and Security Council asked the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights (African Commission) — the Banjul, Gambia-based AU rights body — to urgently investigate reported atrocities in El Fasher, and other areas in Darfur, and to make recommendations on accountability for perpetrators.  The African Commission adopted a resolution on 4 June outlining the deployment of a fact-finding mission to investigate violations, analyse the gender dimensions of the conflict and determine if crimes under international law have been committed.  On 21 June, the Peace and Security Council reiterated its call for investigations and agreed on additional concrete steps, including a proposal to convene an AU extraordinary summit on Sudan.  Perpetrators of atrocities in Sudan have enjoyed impunity for decades, so the call for investigations is a crucial first step toward delivering justice to victims of crimes committed in the conflict. The African Commission must, without delay, seize this opportunity. While its actions hitherto have hardly matched the scale and gravity of the conflict, the prospect of Peace and Security Council-mandated investigations signals a turning point in the AU’s response.  Perpetrators of atrocities in Sudan have enjoyed impunity for decades, so the call for investigations is a crucial first step toward delivering justice to victims of crimes committed in the conflict. The African Commission must, without delay, seize this opportunity. Most urgently, the commission must engage with the Peace and Security Council and Sudanese authorities to secure access and safety guarantees for the proposed fact-finding mission.  If it cannot access the country, it must embrace a versatile methodology in collecting testimonies and evidence, including by conducting interviews via audio or video communication and visiting neighbouring countries to speak to those who have experienced or witnessed violations. Investigations by the African Commission, focused on documenting and preserving evidence for future trials, could deter further violations by sending a strong message to perpetrators that they will face consequences for their actions.  They will also be a timely complement to the ongoing work of the UN-mandated  Independent International Fact-Finding Mission for Sudan. But the people of Sudan — already feeling forgotten — might doubt that the African Commission will step up to the plate. Indeed, the AU has disappointed them before.  After the 2019 Khartoum massacre, in which security forces killed at least 100 protestors, the Peace and Security Council tasked the AU Commission — the Addis Ababa-based AU secretariat — to coordinate with the Intergovernmental Authority on Development and the African Commission in investigating the incident.  Initiation of the investigation was at first delayed because the AU Commission failed to communicate with the African Commission on the way forward. Eventually, the outbreak of Covid-19 dashed any hopes for such investigation as many AU activities ground to a halt amid the pandemic. An African Commission fact-finding mission on reports of slave trade in Libya, requested by the AU Commission, in 2017 has also not taken place. An inquiry into the killing of dozens of migrants in a detention centre in Libya has similarly not happened since the Peace and Security Council requested it in 2019.  The African Commission has cited security concerns and inaccessibility of the country for its failure to undertake these investigations.  More recently, the African Commission failed to publish the findings and recommendations of its 2021 commission of inquiry into atrocities in Ethiopia’s Tigray region, terminating the mission without a single report to show for the two years of work.  Civil society from across the continent and beyond heavily criticised the move, dismissing the stated reasons as “unconvincing”.  This poor record has severely damaged the African Commission’s credibility and legitimacy, particularly in the eyes of victims of atrocities in Africa.  The Peace and Security Council-mandated investigations on El Fasher and the greater Darfur region thus provide an opportunity for the commission to turn things around.  A good starting point would be to emulate its actions during the 2015 Burundi crisis.  After getting Peace and Security Council authorisation, the African Commission quickly dispatched a fact-finding mission to Burundi to investigate human rights violations.  The ball is now in the commission’s court. It should not squander the opportunity to contribute to justice and accountability in Sudan. The people of El Fasher, Darfur and all of Sudan are counting on it. The preliminary findings were submitted to the Peace and Security Council at the end of the mission and were followed by a full-length report.  The African Commission’s speed in responding and compiling findings in this case revealed its potential to effectively investigate mass atrocities. The ball is now in the commission’s court. It should not squander the opportunity to contribute to justice and accountability in Sudan.  The people of El Fasher, Darfur and all of Sudan are counting on it.

0,"The Olympics should be for all women, including Muslim women",AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2024/07/the-olympics-should-be-for-all-women-including-muslim-women/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? Anna Błuś is Amnesty International’s Researcher on Gender Justice in Europe. Excitement is mounting ahead of the Paris Olympic Games, but in a country which proclaims its devotion to “égalité”, Muslim women athletes are being left out and discriminated against – simply because they refuse to give up their right to wear what they want. It’s Saturday and I just completed another parkrun in South London. I lie down on the warm grass and stretch. Around me, there are people of all backgrounds, racial identities, ages and abilities. This is our space, where we come every weekend and chat after racing each other to the finish line. I feel elated, energized, alive. Running has given me so much: an outlet in times of stress, a refuge from trauma, a way to challenge myself and most of all, a lot of fun. It helped me find my people and be a part of a community when I moved to London. To think that all this could be taken away from me is unbearable. In the last few months, my runs have become faster. I have been channeling the feelings of rage and injustice into them and dedicating them to the sportswomen in France who I have been speaking with as part of my work with Amnesty International. Footballers, basketball players, volleyball players, gym-lovers and swimmers – all prevented from doing what they love because they are Muslim and wear hijabs and other forms of religious clothing. Yes, you read that right – this is what is happening in France, the country that wants you to think it champions women’s rights. The country that proclaims its devotion to “égalité”, and that will in just a few days host the 2024 summer Olympic and Paralympic Games. Last September, France’s Minister for Sport announced that no female athlete representing the country will be allowed to compete in the Games if she wears religious headgear. This country, marred by gendered Islamophobia for decades, would rather risk losing medals, discriminate against and exclude incredibly talented sportswomen from its national teams than allow them to be their full selves. But it’s not only during the Olympics that France does not want to see visibly Muslim women. Even at amateur levels and in regional competitions, several sports federations have banned sports hijabs. So, after training for years, excelling in their sport, coaching young girls and considering sports as a professional career, young Muslim women athletes are told to remove their hijabs or give up on their dreams. “It’s a form of violence” It’s “really frustrating, really humiliating,” says Hélène Bâ, a co-founder of the Basket Pour Toutes collective that campaigns to overturn such bans. Instances of referees asking teenage girls to remove parts of their clothing to participate are not uncommon. “It’s gender-based violence because … the referees are, the majority of them are men,” Hélène tells me. “And so, it’s men asking me to take off my clothes. Whether it’s covering the head, whether it’s your T-shirt, whether it’s your dress, this is violence. … It’s a mix of a lot of discrimination and a lot of violence.” This gender-based violence is also a manifestation of Islamophobia, perpetuating systemic racism and discrimination against Muslim women, and reflecting the continuing consequences of France’s history and legacy of colonialism, with profound impacts particularly on racialized women. Volleyball player Assma describes her experience of being prevented from competing. “When I wanted to register for a women’s competition,” she says, “my coach told me it wouldn’t be possible. So I asked her why. And she tells me right away: ‘because you’re wearing something on your head’ … At that moment, I didn’t feel very well and straight away, I knew that it was going to be a problem.” In France  a rule banning religious clothing from competitions has been in place in Football since 2006. A collective of hijab-wearing football players called the Hijabeuses challenged it before French courts, and now also at the European Court of Human Rights. They recently organized “alternative Olympic Games” – truly inclusive of all – near Paris. One of its co-founders, Founé Diawara, stressed to Amnesty International: “Our fight is not political or religious but centred on our human right to participate in sports. Many women are excluded from football fields in France every weekend solely because they wear a veil.” Sports hijabs that meet the safety requirements are authorized by international sports federations such as FIFA, FIBA and FIVB. Moreover, France is the only country in Europe with bans on religious headwear in sports such as women’s football, basketball and volleyball. No other country in the region, at the level of national laws or individual sports regulations, has enshrined bans on religious headwear such as those worn by some Muslim sportswomen and girls.   Discrimination against Muslim women and girls in sport The bans are discriminatory and violate the human rights of Muslim women and girls who wear religious headwear and who play sports, including their right to equality, freedom of expression, association, religion, health, bodily autonomy, physical and psychological integrity, among others. The right to participate in sport itself is a human right under the full spectrum of human rights, for example the right to take part in cultural life, the right to health, including mental health, the right to participate in public life and take decisions about one’s own body and private life. All of these rights must be respected and protected for everyone without discrimination. Hijab bans in sports, and beyond, are a feminist issue and a matter of racial and gender justice as well as a human rights concern. Religion is often a racialized category. Muslim people in Europe are racialized in categories encompassing perceived race, ethnicity and/or nationality, irrespective of their religious practice and actual religion. The wearing of headscarves and other types of religious clothing by Muslim women has long been instrumentalized and negatively stereotyped in our region, particularly in France, to demonize them and homogenize the diverse significance such clothing represents to those who wear it or would wish to do so.    No woman should be coerced into decisions about her clothing or face the impossible choice between career and faith, identity and autonomy. If the discriminatory bans at amateur and professional levels are not eliminated, even fewer Muslim women athletes – who already face systemic barriers in accessing sports in France – will ever reach the Olympics and Paralympics. This is why ahead of, and during, the forthcoming Paris Olympics and Paralympics, Amnesty International is calling for an end to these violations of women and girl athlete’s human rights. We call on everyone who understands the transformational power of sport to use their voice against these  racist, discriminatory and harmful bans on sports hijab. Please use your voice and show solidarity with Muslim women athletes in France.  FIND OUT MORE: https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2024/07/why-hijab-bans-in-french-sports-defy-olympic-values-and-human-rights/      Every year, our global community comes together to fight injustice and support people whose human rights are under threat.

0,Five activists speak out against inhuman prison conditions in Senegal,AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2024/07/five-activists-speak-out-against-inhuman-prison-conditions-in-senegal/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? Ahead of the 2024 presidential election, the Senegalese authorities launched a wave of repression targeting dissenting voices. Between January and December 2023, more than 1,000 people were arrested, according to the Collective of families of political prisoners. These included journalists, activists, and protesters who were arbitrarily detained for taking part in demonstrations or expressing their opinions on social media. For years, Amnesty International has been advocating for improved prison conditions in Senegal, particularly solutions to overcrowding and squalid, unsanitary conditions, as well as the protection of specific groups of people in prison. This Nelson Mandela International Day, Amnesty International presents interviews with five human rights defenders, who were unjustly detained, about their time in prison and the horrific conditions they had to endure. An activist targeted with terrorism-related charges, Nafissatou Gueye spent seven months in a women’s prison in Dakar before being released on 16 February 2024. “It’s difficult when you just arrive in prison, and for me it coincided with a very hot weather. The arrivals room is one of the rooms with the most difficult conditions because it’s so crowded. Despite the fans, you feel like you’re drowning in your own sweat. You need a strong mind to survive. A lot of people come out of prison with psychological problems. What affected me most was being separated from my son, who wasn’t yet two years old when I was arrested. This sudden separation was difficult. He came to visit once during my detention. He refused to let me carry him, as he was beginning to forget my face. When I got out, he no longer recognized me, and I had to leave him with his father. “I was struck by the conditions in detention for all women, not just us political prisoners, especially pregnant women and nursing mothers. Babies learn to crawl, sit up and walk in detention. Can you imagine what life is like for women with children there? Most of the mothers in prison are just on remand. But for how long? They are in prison awaiting trial. Long pre-trial detention for mothers and pregnant women is something I feel strongly about. It would be better to put an electronic tag on them so that they don’t have to spend time in prison.” Fatou Kiné is an activist who was arrested on 2 June 2023 after publishing a tweet and detained for four months. Since leaving Liberté 6 penal camp, Fatou has often fainted, even though she was in good health at the time of her arrest. “At 6pm, as soon as I entered the warrant officer’s office at the police station, he threw me to the ground and started hitting me. He said I knew demonstrators, I told him I didn’t, but he kept hitting me. Another man came into the office and started hitting me too. I was handcuffed so I couldn’t protect myself from the beatings. I was beaten until five or six in the morning. I went 48 hours without eating or drinking. They didn’t give me any food and they wouldn’t let my family bring me anything to eat. I have been touched by all their insults. My mother is no longer alive, and they insulted her. When they took me back to my cell, I heard the call to prayer, and I cried. I went back and forth between the cell and the warrant officer’s office. And each time I was humiliated by insults and physical violence. I just wanted to leave the station, so I signed the police report. I’m bound to have after-effects, because when they hit you, they make sure it hurts.” Activist Binta Gueye was arrested after publishing two posts on Facebook about the postponement of the 2024 presidential election. Arrested on 14 February 2024, she was held for 14 days at the Liberté 6 penal camp in Dakar. “When I arrived at the prison, the guards did a body search on me. I was menstruating, but I was forced to take off my pants. The room was full of women lying on the floor. When you’re lying next to the toilet, you can’t put your mattress on the floor because those who come out of the toilet walk on it with wet feet and your mattress is soaked and dirty. For a week, the guards put me in charge of sweeping up, even though I arrived there with an injured foot. The guards treated us like rubbish. They don’t see the inmates as human beings. The wardens shout at them, insult them… When you’re outside, you hear that there are activities to help the inmates reintegrate, but there’s nothing at all. It hurt me to see these injustices. There are detention orders that last for years. There’s an intellectually disabled woman who spent six years there without being tried. It’s as if they forget their cases. When I got out, I felt the need to fight for women in prison.” An activist known for his fundraising campaigns, Hannibal Djim was arrested on 8 February 2023, detained for a year in Dakar’s Rebeuss prison and then released without trial. During his detention, he went on hunger strike twice, in protest against his detention and the conditions of the prisoners. He is now suffering from numerous after-effects, including memory and digestive problems. “It’s a form of detention that doesn’t respect human rights. There were 218 of us in a 70 sq m room. At night, to go to bed, one detainee would lie on the floor, and another would lie next to him, head to tail, so that they were packed in as tightly as possible, and so on with other detainees to form a line, and once the line of detainees lying on the floor was long enough, there were guys who came to push them even closer together. But there was a period when, instead of lying down, the prisoners stayed seated all night. After six months, nobody had told me what I’d done. I had made six requests for provisional release, all of which were rejected. So, I started a hunger strike that lasted 33 days. I suffered severe hypoglycaemia and was taken to an intensive care unit. I lost so many memories. When I came out, I felt like a stranger. I lost everything, my job and my savings, because life in prison is very expensive. It’s as if I had to start my life all over again.” Pape Fara Ndiaye was arrested on 30 March 2023 for taking part in an unauthorized demonstration. He was tried and acquitted by the courts after seven months in Rebeuss prison and then Cap Manuel prison in Dakar. “Detention conditions are very inhumane, I wouldn’t say just for political prisoners, but for all prisoners. It’s unsanitary, there are food issues and overcrowding. For the first few nights, I was on my feet from 10pm to 6am. Food preparation and storage conditions are not good. Because of the overcrowding, you have access to the yard on alternate days. Prisoners are keen to get out into the yard. Access to medical care is very difficult. You have to be in a very critical situation for the guards to take you to the infirmary. I’ve been twice, but they only give you paracetamol. Access to care and medical treatment should be reviewed by the prison administration.” Amnesty International contributed to the conference on justice in Senegal from 28 May to 4 June 2024, one of the recommendations of which was the improvement of prison conditions.

0,Balancing Acts: Debt Management and the Right to Education in South Africa,AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2024/07/balancing-acts-debt-management-and-the-right-to-education-in-south-africa/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? In 1994, the new democratic government of South Africa inherited an unsustainable budget deficit, rampant inflation (18.9% in 1991), depressed investor confidence, a mountain of debt and a currency crisis from the apartheid state. The previous regime had racked up debt to cope with the sanctions placed upon the country from the 1980s onwards and sustain the apartheid regime. In addition to high levels of debt, the new African National Congress (ANC) government had to table a budget that for the first time was aimed at providing adequate services to the entire country, including the majority population who had previously been wholly marginalised and underserved. From 1994 to 2008, government policies focused on restoring macroeconomic stability. Total public sector debt was reduced from 44% of GDP to less than 20%. Through a strategy of redistribution and growth, the government increased the tax base, streamlined the revenue authority and tax system, implemented an inflation target, improved the debt mix in favour of lower interest rates, better credit ratings, and a balance in favour of domestic debt over external debt. This allowed government to increase funding to the social sector (including education, housing, water and sanitation, and health) by an average annual real growth of 2.1% between 1995 and 2000 and 8.3% between 2000 and 2006. By 2006, the budget balance was in surplus. Spending on education took the largest share of total expenditure at 18.2%. However, following the housing and credit crisis that rocked the global economy in 2008, the budget balance of 1.7% of GDP moved into deficit at -3.8%. Nevertheless, the government still managed to maintain spending in key areas like education, while the global economy began to slowly recover. As the economic crisis continued, government began to reprioritise spending and decrease additional allocations to the public sector (see graph below). Unknown at the time, this decline in government resources was also severely hampered by corruption and what we now know to be state capture. The 2016 State of Capture Report revealed systemic corruption at the political level of the country, which influenced state decision-making in favour of private individual interests. The Zondo Commission was established in 2018 to investigate allegations of state capture and in 2022 the final reports were released. It has been estimated that South Africa lost R50 billion to state capture – equivalent to one-sixth of the total basic education budget for 2023/24. The Covid-19 pandemic further constricted the country’s finances with a loss of 8.2% in GDP in 2020, widening the budget deficit to 9.9% of GDP. In addition, long-term debts held by government from the early years of democracy were due for re-financing. This, however, has come at the cost of higher interest rates following the economic shocks of 2009 and 2020, combined with rising global interest rates in response to inflation. State capture and the weakening of economic institutions, a worsening exchange rate, and continued state-owned enterprise defaults on government-guaranteed debt also pushed up the risk profile of South Africa and thus increased interest costs on new debt. These combined effects pushed the debt to GDP ratio from 20% in 2008 to 74% by the end of 2023. This has meant interest and repayment costs have incrementally eaten away at growth in spending on public services. In the 2024 Budget, debt service costs were the second largest area of expenditure at R382.2 billion, after social protection, with basic education being third at R324.5 billion. Section 29 (1)(a) of the South African Constitution guarantees the right to a basic education for everyone. Section 29 (1)(b) elaborates that everyone has the right “to further education, which the state, through reasonable measures, must make progressively available and accessible.” In other words, primary and secondary education is a right that must be immediately realisable, and must be of adequate quality, and available and accessible to all. However, in ratifying the UN International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), South Africa declared that, contrary to S29(1)(a) it will “give progressive effect to the right to education… within the framework of the National Education Policy and available resources thereby effectively making a reservation to Articles 13(2)(a) and 14”. This has been held by the Constitutional Court to breach Section 29 of the Constitution. In 2024, education received 6.4% of GDP, a sizeable portion of the government budget. Basic education is over two thirds of total education spending, but many primary and secondary schools continue to charge fees in addition to the indirect costs for transportation and uniforms that students and their families must find. Several schools still have inadequate and unsafe infrastructure, including basic pit toilets, which are in breach of the government’s own targets. Many schools suffer from classroom overcrowding with very high student to teacher ratios. This, together with a lack of equal access for poor and black learners, and sub-standard quality of training of teachers, contributes to poor literacy and numeracy outcomes. Amnesty International has documented how this undermines the right to education as guaranteed by the constitution and international law. Clearly South Africa’s budget plays a key role in ensuring that education is available and accessible to all. The graph shows the growth in debt service costs, the education budget and inflation. As the figure indicates, the austerity approach to budgeting, to manage rising debt costs, has slowed annual growth in education spending since the 2008 crisis. Since COVID-19, growth in education expenditure has barely kept pace with inflation. Debt service costs, however, shot up in 2009, and have remained so. Debt has certainly played a role in crowding out spending on education. This has been echoed by Equal Education and Save the Children. In South Africa, 5.8% of the population pays about 92% of all personal income tax. This group is also paying about 85% of value-added tax. Together with the country’s already high indebtedness, this suggests limited options for generating additional resources. And it will clearly impact the ability of government to provide quality basic education for all. Concurrently, the government’s approach of implementing austerity has failed to curb the growth in debt as budgets have shrunk. On top of this, the revelation of extensive state corruption has impeded progress. It is clear that the lack of sufficient finance may simply be a symptom of the state of how South Africa’s institutions are managed and resourced. To date the country has not had to seek debt relief through programmes such as the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative or Common Framework. If current trends in debt management continue, however, South Africa will be increasingly more reliant on the international global financial architecture and Bretton Woods Institutions to determine its future. If the Government of National Unity wishes to truly transform the economy, it will need to strengthen institutions, reduce corruption, re-evaluate the equity of the tax system, and invest more in education, including training quality teachers, building adequate and well-equipped schools and ensuring pupils emerge from schooling able to contribute to human capital and the future of the country.

A moment of joy for sports fans around the world. A moment to embrace the values of Olympism: excellence, respect and friendship. But how can such values be embraced when the French authorities’ efforts to improve gender equality and inclusivity in sports do not apply to one group of women and girls: Muslims who wear religious head coverings? At the 2024 Olympic Games, the host country France has banned Muslim women from wearing a sports hijab or any other form of religious headgear when they compete for France. Such a ban is imposed in several sports in France, including football, basketball and volleyball, in competitions at all levels, including youth and amateur ones. The bans undermine efforts to make sports more inclusive and mean that Muslim players and athletes who wear a hijab in France will continue to be discriminated against. A new briefing by Amnesty International, “We can’t breathe anymore. Even sports, we can’t do them anymore.” violations of Muslim women’s and girls’ human rights through hijab bans in sports in France, documents the experiences of Muslim women players and their allies and their message on hijab bans is loud and clear: they must be overturned. This publication attempts to shed light on discriminatory practices in French sports which violate the human rights of Muslim women and girls. Amnesty International believes that when the world will be watching its athletes compete for medals and exercising their right to practice sport without discrimination, it should also cast a critical eye on the Olympics host country, which does not apply Olympic values to everyone. Bans on hijabs exclude Muslim women who wear them from competitions in France, making them less visible and, in some cases, exposing them to humiliation as decisions about whether they can play a match are decided in front of the watching audience. Hélène Bâ, has played basketball since she was five, and is one of the founders of the grassroots organisation Basket Pour Toutes. But she hasn’t been allowed to compete since October 2023. EVERYONE SEES YOU GOING FROM THE BENCH TO THE LADDERS AND FOR THEM IT’S JUST THE CASE OF ‘YOU CANNOT PLAY’ BUT FOR YOU IT’S A WALK OF SHAME.” “[It] is a huge part of the passion that you have that’s taken away from you, even physically because you know, practice is usually less intense than the games. Mentally it is also hard because you really feel excluded… everyone knows why you’re not playing.” 27 year old Assma has been excluded from playing volleyball in competitions in northern France: “We are made to believe that in France there is equality between men and women, that women are respected. But when we look into the laws it’s not that at all. We are still very, very far away. And so I have the impression that to make up for it, we are trying to point the finger at Muslim women or Islam in general. And it’s very frustrating and it also affects our identity.” WE CAN’T BREATHE ANYMORE. EVEN SPORTS, WE CAN’T DO THEM ANYMORE.” Diaba Konaté, a French basketball player who was born and raised in France, is now playing NCAA college basketball in the United States. She is a former member of the French Youth National Team would love to play for the French team, but this is not an option for her.  In this way, hijab bans are an ‘own goal’ for France, depriving the country of talented athletes who they should be celebrating. “I love basketball, my family, and my faith,” Diaba said in an Open Letter to the French Basketball Federation signed by 80+ athletes and allies on 8 March 2024. “It would break my heart to give up any one of those, and yet that is what the current French Federation of Basketball guidelines are forcing me to do”. 
 I LOVE BASKETBALL, MY FAMILY AND MY FAITH…IT WOULD BREAK MY HEART TO GIVE UP ANY ONE OF THOSE, AND YET THAT IS WHAT FRENCH FEDERATION OF BASKETBALL GUIDELINES ARE FORCING ME TO DO.”  Sadly, these bans are nothing new. For 20 years, French authorities have embarked on a relentless campaign of harmful lawmaking and regulation of Muslim women’s and girls’ clothing, fuelled by prejudice and deepening gendered discrimination towards Muslim women and girls, and those perceived as Muslim. 22-year-old student “Faiza” (not her real name), who practices various sports including weightlifting, told Amnesty International: “The best way to divide is to create hatred towards another population or a section of a population. It’s very simple, you take all the problems of the world and you put them on a community to say that they are the problem and that they are the ones to concentrate on. … In fact, for me this is what the ‘problem with the veil’ is – it’s not a problem but they purposefully rely on it because it gets people talking and it’s easy to say that all the problems of the world … are caused by immigrants and people who wear the veil. You don’t know what to do anymore because if they put it in your head every day that it is all because of a certain population, you’ll believe it. …. But you must also know that your actions or your political approaches have real consequences on people’s lives.” A French Football Federation rule prohibiting women who wear a headscarf from participating in competitive football matches was upheld by the highest administrative French court in June 2023. This is yet another example of France’s institutions enforcing negative stereotypes about Muslim communities and Islamophobic opinions about what Muslim women should or should not wear.   Founé Diawara is a co-founder of Les Hijabeuses, a collective of footballers who wear the hijab and their allies, that legally challenged the football federation rules: OUR FIGHT IS NOT POLITICAL OR RELIGIOUS BUT CENTRED ON OUR HUMAN RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN SPORTS. MANY WOMEN ARE EXCLUDED FROM FOOTBALL FIELDS IN FRANCE EVERY WEEKEND SOLELY BECAUSE THEY WEAR A VEIL.” The hijab bans violate a number of women’s rights: Hélène Bâ explains: “Studies show that Muslim women who wear the hijab and who are more visible, are more likely to suffer from violence – whether it’s verbal abuse, physical abuse – than men because we are visible. Because I think you’re perceived as inferior also by this society. And so they think that they can say and do things that they wouldn’t say to others. … It’s gender-based violence because … the referees are, the majority of them are men, and so it’s men asking me to take off my clothes, whether it’s covering the head, whether it’s your T-shirt, whether it’s your dress, this is violence. … It’s a mix of a lot of discrimination and a lot of violence”. Feminists and anti-racist women’s rights organisations in France have long campaigned for Muslim women’s rights. Volleyball player Assma also stresses: IN MY FEMINIST STRUGGLES, I WANT WOMEN TO BE ABLE TO DRESS HOW THEY WANT, HOW THEY WISH. … IT’S NOT JUST A ‘MUSLIM ISSUE’, IT’S A HUMAN ISSUE.” “Faiza” told Amnesty International about the “hypocrisy” behind mainstream rhetoric that vilifies Muslim women, denies them a place within some movements that call themselves feminist, as well as their human rights in France: “Given that the values ​​of sport are to bring everyone together…and that especially France… advocates women’s rights and human rights with a capital H, I don’t understand how it can be that if you are of a certain faith and you decide to wear the veil – which will not disturb anyone in any way because it will be sports veils which are like balaclavas – they don’t cause any trouble.” Muslim women and girls experience many barriers to participation in sports in different countries in Europe, but only France has introduced bans on religious headwear in a number of sports. Recent international attention has focussed on the French government’s decision to ban women on the French national Olympic team from wearing a sports hijab, but the bans have a wider impact beyond the 2024 Paris Olympics and Paralympics. Even though there is no national law prohibiting women from wearing religious headgear in sports, some federations in France have introduced bans on religious clothing in competitions. This means that as well as being excluded from participating in sports, some Muslim women and girls will never be able to qualify for the Olympic Games, because the bans prevent them from training and competition opportunities from a young age. On top of that, French bans disregard clothing regulations introduced by sports federations at international level. In 2017, Bilqis Abdul-Qaadir, a former US college basketball player who wears a hijab, led an international campaign that resulted in FIBA overturning its ban on certain kinds of headwear, which included the hijab. At the time, arguments around safety- which are still used by many to defend bans on hijabs in sport- were dismissed, to make basketball more inclusive. I’M THE ONE WEARING IT [HIJAB], SO I’M THE ONE WHO KNOWS THIS IS NOT DANGEROUS, NEITHER FOR ME NOR FOR THE OTHER PLAYERS. THE INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION OF BASKETBALL ALLOWS IT, ALTHOUGH FRENCH FEDERATION DOES NOT… SO IT’S NOT A DANGEROUS ITEM. …” The bans on religious clothing violate Muslim women and girls’ right to participate in cultural life, of which sport is a part. They completely contravene the principles of Olympism, that expressly provide that “the practice of sport is a human right”. The bans are also incompatible with the new human rights’ strategic framework of the International Olympic Committee, so it is disappointing that  the institution has  remained silent on the matter. IT’S THE CORE OF OUR LIFE, IT’S CENTRAL. … IT’S A CONNECTION WITH LIFE. … AND OF COURSE, WE ARE NOT JUST SPEAKING ABOUT SPORTS, WE ARE NOT JUST SPEAKING ABOUT MOVEMENT OR PLEASURE – IT’S ALL CONNECTED AND THAT’S WHY IT’S VERY POWERFUL.” A basketball coach who chose to remain anonymous explains the importance of actions to promote sports for all in France: “I run a session for mums and there are mums of all cultures, from all walks of life, Moroccan, African, French, West Indian. The pleasure they have coming to this training session is to get together, to laugh for a while. There are some who say that even after a tiring day, they feel the need to meet the others. And when they get together and play together, there’s the one with a headscarf and there’s the one with mini shorts, and the one with her arms completely bare. And no one is judging … we are just sharing a common passion…” Those who campaign for Muslim women’s rights in France are rarely listened to by those who make the policies and laws. So they need support and solidarity to amplify their voices, so that they cannot be ignored any longer. WE ARE ALWAYS LEFT OUT, WE ARE ALWAYS LEFT OUT. OUR VOICE NEVER GETS THROUGH. EVEN IF WE SOMETIMES TRY TO MAKE OUR VOICE HEARD. BUT THEN, WE FIND THAT THINGS GET BLOCKED AT SOME POINT”. But players, human rights defenders and sports clubs who support the right of Muslim players to wear the hijab are paying a high price for their support. The Disciplinary Commission of the French Federation of Basketball has sanctioned coaches like Timothée Gauthierot, another Basket Pour Toutes co-founder who is also president of a club on the outskirts of Paris, simply for defending the right of women and girls to wear the sports hijab.   Despite the threats and the sanctions, he continues to support inclusion in basketball: “We worked so hard so that there is a women’s team in all categories, and they often come in groups of friends. And all it takes is for two or three players to stop playing and the whole team stops playing. And so that’s one more reason to say that in fact we can’t let down these two or three girls who wear the veil because it can completely change the team and it can mean that there is no longer a team. And so that’s why we mobilized.” IT’S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT’S UNJUST. … IT’S ABOUT OUR VALUES. AND I REFUSE FOR ANYONE TO BE EXCLUDED FROM THE GROUNDS”. If French authorities and sports federations want to honour their commitments to inclusion and gender equality, they should listen to Muslim women and lift hijab bans. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE ALL PEOPLE EQUAL, TO REALLY SEE ALL PEOPLE’S INCLUSION, REAL INCLUSION, NOT THE INCLUSION THAT THEY’RE TALKING ABOUT…. BE KIND. WE ONLY LIVE ONCE. JUST BE KIND AND ACCEPT EVERYONE.” The three values of Olympism are excellence, respect and friendship. The host country above all others should honour these values. That means respecting all players equally, striving for excellence both in sports competitions and in sports values, and promoting friendships by enabling everyone to take part.

Pride has taken a huge hit in Türkiye over the past few years. In 2015, Pride marches, which had been taking place peacefully for 12 years, were banned by the Istanbul authorities. Yet, activists and allies refused to be silenced and they are still gathering proudly for Istanbul Pride and Istanbul Trans Pride, which organizes separately to discuss topics such as the health, visibility, and constitutional rights of trans+ people in a bid to demand their rights. However, it’s not without its dangers, with many people being subjected to excessive police force, including Can, 29, a trans activist, from Istanbul, Türkiye. In this story, Can reveals why they are risking their life and doing what they can to make sure LGBTI people still have a safe space to come together and be heard. “I remember walking in Trans Equality Day for Trans Pride in Istanbul last year. Even though the march was just 20 meters long, it was a win for our small community. Coming together even though the police were planning to detain us was a win. We have had so many wins, but there’s no time to celebrate them because of all the hardships we continue to suffer. Following Trans Pride in 2023, we suffered an incredible backlash. The number of threats my friends faced on social media was unimaginable. Some of them couldn’t even walk on the streets or take the bus alone because they were targeted by some members of the public. We are always skirting the lines between being safe and unsafe. There is no middle ground, between safety and danger. The same year, I participated in Istanbul Pride. Again, people were detained – including myself. I was very, very lucky. When the police detained me (two hours after Pride, when everyone was done, having coffee or beer, picnicking, and such), they targeted me, chased me and hit my head with their body armour, which led to me bleeding and needing stitches on my head. At one point, they made me thank them for not using reverse clamps [handcuffing from behind, to make sure people cannot move when detained in the detainee bus), which is unlawful but practiced whenever a human rights activist gets detained. Yet, I consider myself one of the lucky ones because I got out the day after. One person from the detainee bus was sent to the Removal Centre in the middle of summer with no AC, water, or food because they were not a Turkish citizen and the police thought they attended pride. Their reason? They looked ‘a bit queer’ in the police’s eyes, and now they cannot enter Türkiye again. In Türkiye, LGBTI+ rights activism is considered in the same category as national security. We’re subjected to arbitrary house raids, detentions, fines, and arrests. My family always knew I was queer, but I finally found the courage to tell them after I started hormone therapy. I sent them a message saying, ‘Can we talk on the phone? It’s a very important and urgent issue.’ I think my message alarmed them. However, while coming out as a non-binary trans was shocking, it wasn’t the end of the world for them.I was lucky and privileged that even though my family and friends did not understand what I was going through, they still supported me and felt comfortable enough to ask questions. Many of my friends cannot say the same. Instead, they face threats in their daily lives.    In my experience, many people in Turkey following and loving characters such as Bülent Ersoy [one of Türkiye’s best-known singers who transitioned to a woman in 1980) and Zeki Müren [a gay icon], meant you were accepted if you fit the ‘social norm’, but fetishized and rejected if you didn’t. While people living abroad are somewhat aware of our situation – ‘Oh, I heard that your Prides are getting banned’ – that’s all they know – and that’s the least of my concerns. Many of us are suffering because of the current economic climate – as a trans person, it’s difficult to get a job or even stay in a government-run student housing. Our more immediate challenges are the day-to-day lack of access to our rights which form the bigger picture of being able to live. I always knew activism was a passion of mine. When I was younger, I was passionate about animal rights, but in 2013, everything clicked in my head with the Gezi Park Protests [police cleared Gezi Park of a small group of protestors opposed to its destruction, causing uproar across the country around the right to protest], and I understood that I had to use my knowledge of media and design for my activism. I now volunteer with Lambdaistanbul, one of the oldest, still-standing LGBTI+ organizations in Türkiye. We run weekly events and workshops to tackle loneliness amongst LGBTI  people. What I love about being a Lambda volunteer is we can freely talk about intersectional issues, ask for more from the local community, and do more. No international organization or government funds our projects, so we can focus on what we want. It’s a local homegrown initiative catering to a local population. I also participate support Trans Pride and Istanbul Pride. We need Trans Pride to connect, create safe places, and celebrate our existence in a climate that does none of these things. We need to see each other because even when we’re dead, we are still not given any respect or dignity. We cannot be buried in peace, and we can’t even claim our memories. In a state that gives us no room to breathe, we need to find alternatives. We were always here and always will be.  We are trapped in a vicious circle where every two weeks, a trans person gets lost, or murdered, or they took their own life. There are very few happy endings, This year, we’ve not had a blanket ban on Pride in Istanbul, but we didn’t publish any information such as the date and time. Yet, the police still act like they are banning events and marches. They will come with fake papers that don’t even have the local district governorship’s signature, or documents addressed to another district, and still detain and torture people. Going forward, LGBTI people need to be able to access the right kind of medical care. Our mental health is getting worse every day. We are trapped in a vicious circle where every two weeks, a trans person gets lost, or murdered, or we find out they took their own life. There are very few happy endings. We cannot access our basic human rights.  Thankfully, we have organizations such as Amnesty International Türkiye on our side. They are one of the few organizations ready to listen without having an agenda. Their campaigns have been crucial this year. We need all the support we can get – it is an incredibly difficult climate for trans people in Türkiye. If you can, please check out Amnesty’s Pride campaigns and send a message to the Minister of Interior in Türkiye, telling them that we demand to use our constitutional rights. We should not be getting detained, tortured and imprisoned for demanding our rights – we deserve to live a safe, happy life, where we can be ourselves.

By David Ngira Somalia’s healthcare sector is ailing. This is despite the country receiving USD 4.5 Billion debt relief from IMF and the World Bank  last year which moved the country’s debt to GDP ratio from 64% to 6%. The relief followed protracted negotiations under the Highly indebted Poor Countries Initiative. The country’s investment in health has reduced, even though debt relief was premised on economic reforms including implementation of a poverty reduction strategy, increasing revenue collection, prioritization of spending on projects and enhancement of public finance and debt management capacity. Analysis indicates that Somalia’s health budget reduced significantly from 8.5% of the budget in 2023 to 4.8% in 2024 despite the reduction in debt repayment from 1.4% of the budget in 2023 to 0.12% of the budget in 2024. Incidentally, the increase in the overall budget by about 10% wasn’t felt in the health sector. This has called into question the country’s commitment to the right to health. Amnesty International’s 2021 report on Somalia’s response to Covid-19 indicated that the country only spent 2% of the national budget on health in 2020 – far from the 15% obligation that African governments committed to allocating in the national health budgets in the Abuja Declaration. Three years on, Somalia’s poor health sector is still characterized by insufficient health personnel, high levels of child and maternal mortality, inadequate and largely under-equipped health facilities, low levels of immunization, and recurrent outbreaks of water borne diseases. All these undermine people’s right to adequate health. Although some progress has been made as reflected in the 2022-2026 strategic plan, the level of health provision still fails the expected human rights standards. This has worsened the suffering of people already struggling to adjust to the implications of the climate crisis on their livelihoods, including its impact on health, housing and food systems. Somalia’s poor health sector is still characterized by insufficient health personnel, high levels of child and maternal mortality, inadequate and largely under-equipped health facilities, low levels of immunization, and recurrent outbreaks of water borne diseases. Somalia’s 2021, 2022 and 2023 budgets show a significant variance between the health budget and expenditure. For instance, 2022 expenditure indicates that only 1.3% of the overall budget was actually spent on health, against an overall allocation of 10.6% of the budget. Similarly, in 2023 Somalia allocated 8.5% of the overall budget to the health sector but only spent 7% of the overall budget on the same. According to Transparency International, corruption has had an important impact on Somalia’s health sector which may result in an unexplained variance between the health budget and expenditure. Authorities should investigate this to identify how much of this variance is due to mismanagement, if any, of the health budget and take legal action against those responsible. Somalia’s development partners should work with the government to strengthen accounting systems and encourage greater fiscal transparency and public participation in budgeting. Expenditures on employee payments which account for most of the health budget must be scrutinized to ensure that the money goes to actual health workers. Somalia must also work to increase its revenue through increased trade, progressive taxes, widening tax base and grants. It must also seal all loopholes for illicit financial flows. This will enhance resources available for allocation to the health sector. Its therefore urgent for the international community to accelerate the development of a Tax Treaty to help countries like Somalia deal with illicit cash outflow. Somalia must also work to increase its revenue through increased trade, progressive taxes, widening tax base and grants. It must also seal all loopholes for illicit financial flows. To be sure, Somalia faces significant security and governance challenges. But military spending, which currently stands at 24% of the budget, must not prevent Somalia from matching its health policies and needs with appropriate budgetary allocations. This will enable the country to adhere to its constitutional and international obligations to guarantee accessible, affordable, and quality healthcare to its people. Two years after coming into power, the Hassan Sheikh administration must now translate its political commitments into practical health gains for Somalis. This requires the government to allocate at least 15% of their budget to health, implement budgets prudently and ensure corruption doesn’t undermine the country’s progress towards health reforms and realization.

0,Inside Lebanon’s Military Court: No place for civilians,AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2024/07/inside-lebanons-military-court-no-place-for-civilians/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? Sahar Mandour is Amnesty International’s Researcher on Lebanon and has been attending a historic torture trial at the country’s Military Court examining the death in custody of Syrian refugee Bashar Abed Saud, following claims of torture at the hands of State Security Agency members. The fifth session and expected verdict is scheduled for 5 July. She’s determined to seek justice, truth and reparation for Bashar’s family. Here, she recounts her insights into a trial process dominated by the Military. As I stood in front of the Military Court on 16 December 2022, I felt a mixture of bravery and fear. I felt brave, because I had made a formal request to the Military to attend this court session, and fearful, as I didn’t receive approval but decided to show up anyway and request it in person. Although court sessions are supposed to be open to the public, in practice, showing up without prior approval could be viewed as defiant and put me on their radar. As a non-Lebanese national living in the country on a residency card basis, I felt particularly vulnerable at the Military Court. I tried to imagine how much harder the situation would be for a Syrian refugee standing before a Military tribunal in Lebanon: terrified to death. I was there to attend a historic trial: the first torture case to reach court (civil or military) since Lebanon passed Law 65 in 2017 criminalizing torture. Since 2017, I have documented the torture and other ill-treatment of dozens of activists, refugees, members of the LGBTI+ community, and other civilians and soldiers alike, in Lebanese detention centres. Despite the dozens of torture complaints filed over the past seven years, none had ever reached trial. A local newspaper exposed the torture of Bashar Abed Saud in September 2022, and published leaked photos documenting gruesome cuts and burns on his dead body. It was hard for the Military to bury this case. It was hard for anyone to shrug and turn the page having seen these photos. Bashar died on 30 August 2022, after just one day in the custody of Lebanon’s State Security Agency. In a groundbreaking indictment in November 2022, the investigative military judge accused five State Security members of torturing him to death. At the first trial session on 16 December 2022, the five members presented the same account of the events that led to Bashar’s death – placing the blame on only one officer for beating him to contain him. At the second session on 5 May 2023, I sat in the Military Court from 9 am until late afternoon awaiting the trial, but as soon as the judge announced it, a judge had to adjourn the session because one of the defendant’s lawyer was absent. The lawyer appointed by Bashar’s family requested that Amnesty International continue to attend the court sessions especially because dozens of torture complaints against security and military agencies have been dismissed without investigation. He feared that once eyes look away, the Court would close this case too. Researchers from other organizations joined me, and together we acted as a human rights convoy symbolically observing the Court not to dismiss such a horrifying case of torture, especially given that the victim, as a refugee, belonged to one of the most vulnerable communities in Lebanon. Three sessions were adjourned due to the absence of a lawyer or a forensic doctor, but I continued to attend every session. These trial sessions gave me a rare insight into the workings of the Military Court. It is run on discipline – defendants are seated in a cage during the proceedings and are required to show the utmost respect to the judge: they stand to attention, hold their hands behind their backs and must ask for permission to be allowed to speak. In one day at court, the judge reviews at least 30 cases. At the end of each brief interrogation, the judge asks the defendant: “What do you request from the Court?” The typical response is: “Compassion and mercy, your honour”. These words stayed with me. One should request justice from a court, yet it seems these defendants only feel able to hope for compassion or mercy. When one of the five defendants’ lawyers requested that the first session be held privately, the judge rejected the request, stating: “Amnesty International’s researcher is in the audience, and it is a matter of public opinion: we have nothing to hide”. In a case like Bashar’s, the family lawyer is not allowed to address the judge directly or present notes and evidence to the prosecutor during the court session. The victim is an afterthought – this is about the military trying their own. At the time of his death, Bashar was 30 years old and had three children, including a one-month-old baby. He had defected from the Syrian army eight years before his arrest and moved to Lebanon to work as a porter. He lived with his family in the Sabra and Shatila camp for Palestinian refugees in Beirut. In the last two years, I documented Bashar’s life exhaustively yet was never able to talk directly to his family – who were understandably afraid. Refugees in Lebanon are in a precarious position and remain at risk of arrest and deportation at any moment. During the hearings, according to the officers’ narrative, Bashar confessed to being a drug dealer and addict, a member of a terrorist organization, and an arms smuggler after his arrest by the Military Police. They claimed he arrived at the State Security office high on Captagon, a synthetic narcotic. “He had taken two, three, four or five pills, sir”, said the officer, denying he was beaten. The forensic report, however, confirmed that there were no drugs in his system. They said that Bashar was agitated, resisted interrogation and hit an officer “known for his temper and high self-esteem”. The officer hit the refugee twice, with a phone charger wire to subdue him. The refugee collapsed as a result of drug use, they claimed. “Why would we torture him if he already confessed?!”, said the officer in charge to the judge. The judge asked the angry officer: “Is it true that you are known for beating detainees?” His response: “I only beat them hard for confessions if they’re arrested on terrorism charges.” The judge listened intently, interrogated thoroughly and with vigour. Bashar, the deceased refugee, was mentioned only through the narrative of the people accused of killing him. By the fourth session, all the defendants had been released from detention, including the “angry officer” accused of carrying out the beating. The judge informed the prosecution that Bashar’s family had dropped charges against the officers. There have been whispers that Bashar’s family had been intimidated into dropping the charges. Who could blame them? As we await the verdict on 5 July, one thing is patently clear: this trial is not about justice for Bashar and his family, but more an internal disciplinary process for the military to protect and punish, differentiate between “honest mistakes” and shameful behaviour, and reaffirm that military discipline is above critique. There is never any justification for torture. Suspected perpetrators of torture must be held accountable in independent and impartial proceedings that meet international fair trial standards. The Military Court does not meet these requirements and its jurisdiction over criminal cases, like the jurisdiction of any military court or commission, should always be limited to trials of military personnel for breaches of military discipline. For Lebanese authorities to be serious about eliminating torture in detention facilities, they must refer such cases to ordinary civilian courts, regardless of the accusations against victims of torture, whether terrorism, arm smuggling, drug use, or simple agitation in an interrogation room.

0,LGBTI rights in Uganda: An interview with activist Jaqueline Kasha,AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2024/06/lgbti-rights-in-uganda-an-interview-with-activist-jaqueline-kasha/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? In a country where homosexuality is criminalized, Jacqueline Kasha, a courageous Ugandan activist, has founded Freedom and Roam Uganda (FARUG), a lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and intersex rights organization. In 2011, she was awarded the Martin Ennals Award for Human Rights Defenders. In 2013 she was awarded the Nuremberg International Human Rights Award for her continuous LGBTI activism.  In May last year, the Ugandan parliament passed one of the most draconian laws against homosexuality, a law that imposes a punishment of life imprisonment for same-sex sexual acts, and up to 10 years behind bars for attempted same-sex sexual acts. It also imposed the death penalty for “aggravated homosexuality” and criminalizes the “promotion” of homosexuality, a provision that encourages homophobia. In this Q&A, Jacqueline, who is currently in the USA recovering from surgery, talks about the impact the law is having on her community, how she stays safe in the face of homophobia and what steps she wants to see President Yoweri Museveni take to better protect LGBTI people in Uganda. I was at an orthopedics appointment in Massachusetts USA, watching everything on my phone. I wished I was home with my people and yet I knew I needed to take care of my health if I was to continue this fight. I had so many mixed feelings that day. In some instances, I was glad I was far away from home. I was dumbfounded at the so-called “debate” and how ignorant our house of representatives are. I was also very sad at the level of hatred that was displayed that day towards another segment of society. It was heartbreaking. I wished they put in such effort into other bills that really benefit us as people, instead of wasting more taxpayers’ money on duplicating an existing law on unfounded grounds by a few disgruntled community members. It was a very dark day in the history of our human rights movement, domestically and globally. My phone was buzzing with panic from LGBTI persons, others asking if they could go to my house for a few days. I received lots of media interview requests which I turned down as I was not in the right state of mind, especially since I had just been told that I had to wait another five months for my surgery…It was a terrible day. There weren’t any unusual reactions from those who know me because there wasn’t really anything that was going to change about who I am. It was about all LGBTI persons. For me, it was about the messages of solidarity, love and strength from across the world. And yes, I also had to fight so many trolls who just couldn’t stay off my social media pages. A lot has changed, especially as this is the second time LGBTI persons in Uganda are going through the same tragedy. In 2014, not so many people were involved in LGBTI rights activism, so many were still in the closet and few activists were on the frontline. This time around, so many LGBTI persons are visible and have publicly advocated for their rights and joined the struggle for their rights. Their visibility also means that LGBTI people are more vulnerable than in 2014. There was more panic and distress this time because of the high level of media exposure. This time it was more brutal than in 2014. Anti-LGBTI actors had spent several years preparing for this crackdown on LGBTI rights, so they were more aggressive and organized than the first time. Several LGBTI persons have since gone underground which is now impeding all our efforts, especially in the health sphere in the fight against HIV, mental illness and economic disparities. We have recorded the highest number of abuses and violations over the past year than we have reported in the last 23 years, since the movement for respecting the rights of LGBTI persons was started. Many have since gone into exile and asylum, while many others have withdrawn and gone back into the closet. There is an increase in suicide attempts and suicides and there are more illegal detentions and arbitrary arrests. Since the closure of our Drop In Centres (DICs) across the country, many people have stopped receiving free treatment, health related information, goods and resources. It’s a mess to be honest. However, when we started this human rights movement, we didn’t anticipate the level at which it would grow. We weren’t fully prepared, but we did invest a lot in our growth as resilient activists, meaning it’s not over until we say it’s over. We are still fighting regardless. We shall not lose hope and shall not stop until they stop violating our human rights. This is a tricky question. But very important. I’m safe most of the time because I have the privilege to travel and tell the world about our plight, building allies and networks. Those connections are the ones that have made the Ugandan LGBTI rights movement one of the strongest on the continent and even globally. I was able to build a strong protection network around myself. I never move alone, I have a security system I follow since I have faced physical attacks in the past, stalkers and instigators threatening me on social media and in person. I have been arrested in the past, but I wasn’t charged because I know the law very well. They are just disruptive mechanisms that I have learnt over the years. We have been training LGBTI persons in some of these security measures, both physical and digital. So sometimes the law has loopholes that enable our policy holders and law enforcement to act with impunity. For example, they have been arresting people for no reason, but they cannot just arrest me anyhow because I am aware that human rights apply to all and I will bankrupt the country with lawsuits if they dare to violate my rights without just reason. Right now, I am still in the USA recovering from my surgery but still fighting for the rights of LGBTI persons daily. Silence. Many of the Members of Parliament and anti- gay groups know the truth, but they choose to keep silent. That breaks my spirit and heart every day. They know we are not paid to be LGBTI, they know we don’t recruit anyone, they know we need to urgently be integrated into the national HIV/Aids plan, but they continue to discriminate against us. They know that since time immemorial, homosexuality has existed in our African traditions and customs and was never criminalized until colonialism, but they choose to remain silent simply because they can use us as a political ladder. The silence kills me, and it will destroy so many communities around the world.  He should stop listening to falsehoods or misinformation that his aides feed him, he must use his own reasoning to understand issues of sexuality and gender and discuss with his party and cabinet the dangers of discriminating against a certain segment of society. Many talented, experienced and well-educated people have left the country because of fear. The country is losing out on a lot of human resource. The economy is being affected. Our religious values are being trampled upon by many fake pastors who are looking for cheap popularity and money from religious fundamentalists. I want to request that he puts together a taskforce that can work with LGBTI activists to provide him with proper information that he can use to understand LGBTI identities and rights instead of relying on a section of people around him are who are hiding the correct information from him. The President needs to understand that discrimination hinders development. Every year, our global community comes together to fight injustice and support people whose human rights are under threat.

0,Abortion rights in the USA: An interview with Tarah Demant,AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2024/06/abortion-rights-in-the-usa-an-interview-with-tarah-demant/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? Tarah Demant is National Director of Programmes at Amnesty International USA, where she campaigns on issues such gender justice and abortion rights. The past year has been one of the toughest for her, as the USA has seen a huge rollback on human rights. In this interview, she talks about the impact of abortion bans on people in the USA, how she’s advocating for change at every level and why the hope and resilience of activists across the country spurs her on… There has been an incredible backlash against gender justice throughout the Americas, including in the United States. One of the most obvious examples of this backlash is the attack on abortion rights across the region. Honestly, it’s exhausting. The attacks are relentless. Anti-rights actors are moving state-by-state trying to push further abortion bans and criminalization. These attacks on abortion are hand-in-hand with broader anti-gender attacks across the country, including vicious attacks against transgender children. It’s devastating. It has real impact on people. And it takes a toll emotionally. There is a lot of hope and resilience in the community. People show up day after day for each other, for their friends and neighbours, and for people they will never know.  But it’s also a privilege to work in this space — there is a lot of hope and resilience in the community. People show up day after day for each other, for their friends and neighbours, and for people they will never know. In the toughest places — in the most conservative states — people are their fiercest. Fighting alongside these incredible activists inspires a lot of hope.  And no matter what happens politically, we are determined — we will never stop fighting. And that commitment is where I find a lot of energy. We’re working across the country to combat abortion bans and to win further protections for abortion rights at multiple levels. We are documenting the impact of abortion bans and restrictions in our research, showing the real, human impacts of these human rights violations. We’re helping to connect global activists to local activists—creating solidarity and learning that has really buoyed work here nationally. And we’re lobbying the federal government: I spend a lot of time educating Congress on abortion and pushing the Administration to take every action it can to protect abortion rights.  But we’re also ensuring we’re where the fight really is now: at the state level. The Supreme Court decision that overturned Roe meant that abortion rights are now left entirely to the individual states—and we’ve had to adjust very quickly to how we try to effect change as an international human rights organisation working at national level. We’re equipping our activists in every state with the tools to engage in advocacy in their state as well as within their local communities: lobbying state officials, talking about abortion in conversations, raising abortion rights in local council meetings, ensuring abortion is always on the agenda in local governments. And we’re invested in states where voters can weigh in directly — like our work in Arizona, where we are fighting to pass a ballot initiative that would protect abortion in the state constitution.  We’re making sure that Amnesty is showing up for abortion rights in the USA — with our research, our lobbying, and our activists at home AND globally. And it matters. We can and will win. We have talked to doctors who’ve had to turn away patients desperate for their care. We’ve heard from families who have tried to figure out how to go thousands of miles to seek the care that their loved one needs and ultimately, we’ve heard stories of people who’ve been forced to give birth by the state because they couldn’t access abortion care. But we’ve also witnessed stories of hope and communities of incredible resilience, of people across every state in the country and across every country in the Americas who are standing up for their rights, who are fighting back and who are fighting for each other. In a state like Texas that has one of the most extreme anti-abortion laws, including a bounty-hunter system for those “assisting” in abortion, activists are unbowed. They are working every day to get people the information and care they need – even if that means travelling out of state. They are also supporting each other against a backdrop of relentless political attacks and threats to their safety and freedom.  There is an incredibly dangerous backlash against gender equality in the United States, across the region and globally.  The anti-gender movement within the United States represents a very small minority of opinion, but it is very powerful, incredibly well-funded, very well-organized.  And there is national and transnational coordination with shared strategies and objectives that challenge hard-won gains toward gender equality on multiple levels. These include attacks on the very idea of gender itself, pushing instead for a world in which only so called “traditional family” and stereotyped gender roles are accepted and protected. This means controlling women’s choices and behaviours, limiting people’s reproductive autonomy — including by restricting access to abortion, birth control, and sexuality education — and erasing LGBTQIA+ people altogether.  We must take this threat incredibly seriously and fight it at every turn. The fight for abortion rights will not stop with abortion. Every person’s autonomy is on the line. And we are going to continue to show up to that fight every day, even when it’s not the front page of the news.  We’re working side-by-side in communities across the world to defend these rights—to defend our rights.  We’re there.  And we can do more and become more as people join us in this fight. We will keep fighting in every state across the nation and in every nation across the region, because we believe in the human rights of all people, and we believe in the future we’re building together. And we know that together we can win. I believe in the future we are building — and I’m not alone. People are fired up across the country, particularly on abortion rights. I believe in a future where laws protect our rights, where women and people who can get pregnant control their own bodies and lives, where LGBTQIA+ people can live safely and authentically — a future where we protect and support each other and where we understand that each of our freedoms is tied together. It can sometimes be hard to feel hopeful when the politics are so dangerous and skewed, but whether on any given day I feel optimistic or pessimistic, I remain determined to build that future.

After the decree that states our identity is a mental health issue, things have become even more difficult. When the decree came out, the whole of Peru was in shock, so we said: ‘We have to do something’. We quickly created a national coordinating body which several organizations from all over Peru joined in order to see how to confront this setback in human rights. We issued a statement and organized a sit-in in Lima on 17 May. I am from Cusco, and I travelled to Lima to participate in the demonstration. We gathered in front of the Ministry of Health to demand that this decree that harms us be repealed. It was very gratifying to see so much unity, so many transgender activists demanding our rights. I started my activism in 2020 with Amnesty International’s Diverses group. The project opened my eyes because, even though I was a trans person, I was out of touch with what other people were going through. So, I started to ask myself: What can I do to try and change this? That’s how I got involved in activism, to try to change things. Now I run a collective called Fraternindad Transdivergente. I work with trans children and young people, because I don’t want them to go through what I and others like me have gone through. I want to be the kind of support that I haven’t had. I always tell them that I admire their courage because, at their age, I hadn’t come out and I didn’t even know myself. I tell them that activism is not easy, and that many people question our motivations, telling us that we are wasting our time, but I tell them not to be discouraged. I tell them: ‘We are doing this because we want a better world for us and for those to come’. The Pride march in Lima began in June 2002. In Cusco it started in 2016, because it is a very conservative, very traditional, religious city. Also, the march coincides with the local festival and the LGBTI flag is very similar to the local flag, which makes it seem like everyone supports the rights of LGBTI persons, but in reality, it still bothers a lot of people. The good thing is that over time the marches have grown, and more and more young people are participating. For me it is very nice to see that they are already free or trying to be free, that they are losing that fear of being judged and that they are going out on the streets and shouting for their rights. This is the third year that I have participated in a march, because before, when I had not yet come out of the wardrobe as a trans man, I didn’t dare. I always wanted to take part, but I was afraid of being seen.  My first march was very nice because, first of all, I had already come out as a trans person and then because my friends were the ones who encouraged me, they said ‘Hey, we’ll go with you, let’s go’. It felt very nice to know that I was not alone. I was at the very front of the march, there with the batucada [drums], the giant flag and surrounded by all the other people. It was a very beautiful experience, very powerful. The increased visibility of trans men, of transmasculinities has also been a huge step forward for us. Although we are still invisible. The state does not support us, we are unprotected. That is why the visibility in the march gives us strength, because more people see that we exist. I also see that acceptance has been growing little by little, although there are still people who insult us or even attack us when we demonstrate. But there is also music, people dancing, people expressing themselves, and that is very powerful. What we need now is a law that protects people’s gender identity and expression. Without a law it is very difficult to start the process of changing your name, which is the basis for changing your identity card and, with that, accessing health, education and work. Without that, everything is very difficult. The process is cumbersome, it is long and expensive, and it is also difficult to find people to help you with the process of changing your name because you need lawyers. Everything would be much easier if there was a law that allows trans people to fully express themselves. Visibility is very important but not only in this month. It seems that this month is when everyone supports us, when they are with us. This month we have rights, this month we exist. But beyond visibility, what is important is the fight to change things, and that should happen all the time, not just this month.” Every year, our global community comes together to fight injustice and support people whose human rights are under threat.

0,Debt relief and prudent financial management key to adequate education financing in Eritrea,AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2024/06/debt-relief-and-prudent-financial-management-key-to-adequate-education-financing-in-eritrea/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? Although Eritrea has a self-proclaimed policy of self-reliance the country remains heavily in debt. According to the World Bank, Eritrea’s debt to GDP in 2023 was estimated at 219% although the figure has since marginally dropped to 211% in 2024. This is significantly above Africa’s average of 63.5%. Eritrea largely owes this debt to domestic banks due to sanctions limiting its access to foreign financial markets.   By this account, Eritrea has one of the highest debt to GDP ratios in sub-Saharan Africa and globally and is in debt distress according to the World Bank and IMF. In 2022, the country spent 33.4% of the national budget on debt servicing. Heavy debt repayment has undermined budgeting on social services such as education and undermined the country’s progress towards realization of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  Eritrea is at the pre-decision point in the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative and so has not yet benefited from debt relief. Due to continued conflict, international sanctions and the overwhelming size of its debt, Eritrea has been unable to repay its loans.  This has prompted the Qatari National Bank to take the Eritrean government to court in the UK and the US. At the same time, Eritrea is ranked by Transparency International as one of the most corrupt countries in the world. Corruption has undermined budget implementation and reduced resources available for public services including education. The situation is further exacerbated by political repression, weak rule of law and widespread authoritarian practices which limit the ability of politicians, public, media and civil society to exercise sufficient vigilance over corruption.   Eritrea’s obligation to guarantee the right to education is anchored both in Eritrea’s Constitution as well as in international and regional laws to which it is a signatory. These include the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the International Covenant on Social, Economic and Cultural Rights, to which Eritrea has acceded. Eritrea has also ratified the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights as well as the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, all of which obligate states to not just guarantee the minimum core of the right to education duty but also to progressively fulfil it. Eritrea’s education budget shows that spending still falls below the African average education spending. The Global Partnership for Education estimates that Eritrea’s expenditure on Education was 0.94% of GDP in 2016 rising to about 2% in 2020 but is then estimated to have stagnated at below 2% of GDP in most subsequent years. This is below African average education spending of 3-4% of GDP per year.  The high level of corruption in Eritrea has undermined its capacity to utilize its resources to address socio-economic rights and further undermined the realization of the right to education.   This low spending calls into question Eritrea’s commitment to progressively realise the right. It should also be highlighted that this expenditure level still falls below the 4-5% of GDP recommended by the Incheon Declaration.  Even where there has been increased expenditure this has not translated into concrete improvement in the quality of education with challenges such as low access to pre-primary education (20%) and secondary education (48%).  48% of primary school-age children in Eritrea are not in school compared to the average sub-Saharan African out of primary school rate of 20%. At tertiary level the male and female enrolment rate is only 4% and 3% respectively which fall below the African average tertiary enrolment rate of 9.4%. Even where children can access school the country continues to experience low levels of primary and secondary school completion and transition rates. The high student to trained teacher ratios are also a major factor impacting the quality of education. According to UNESCO one of the key factors that contribute to low basic education completion rate is the high incidence of child marriage. Eritrea’s education challenges are compounded by the forced conscription of students and teachers as well as inadequate trained teachers. Due to extended international isolation, and governance related issues, including the government’s unwillingness to widen the democratic and political space, Eritrea has had limited capacity and opportunity to attract donor funding to the education sector. This in turn has restricted their engagement with creditors on issues related to debt relief. The IMF concluded its article IV consultation with Eritrea in 2019 (more than 10 years since the previous one),but has been unable to get the government to sign it off for publication. In the related press release, the IMF also notes that the country’s continued reliance on agriculture and mining, limited foreign investment, and state control of the financial sector, make it more vulnerable to economic shocks. The AfDB’s economic outlook also notes the country’s high level of climate vulnerability. This makes economic recovery and sustained investment in the SDGs challenging. Against this backdrop Eritrea must improve its finance and budgetary transparency and open civic space to enhance public participation in governance and public sector finance, as well as fight corruption to promote the confidence of its citizens, trade, and development partners in its economy. The country must enhance its revenue and tax base including through revenues from mining and in turn invest more in education as well as in other public services, including by reconsidering the level of military spending, diversifying its economy beyond the traditional sectors of mining and agriculture and promoting increased private sector competition and foreign investment. Having rejoined the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD), Eritrea should use this platform to reach out to more multilateral partners. The partial lifting of UN sanctions as well as the normalization of relations with Somalia, Ethiopia and Djibouti further open room for increased cross border trade which would enhance foreign exchange. As indicated above, financial limitations and budget allocation policy decisions have undermined access to quality education in Eritrea. Part of this is due to the heavy indebtedness of the country, a reality which forces it to channel a significant amount of resources to debt repayment. Accordingly, Eritrea should work on HIPC qualification, continue to improve fiscal indicators, and re-engage in multilateral spaces by upping official development assistance (ODA), and support from multilateral development banks. These would enable Eritrea’s financial partners and creditors to work with the country in undertaking a debt relief programme that would provide it with the fiscal space to invest in education. Eritrea should equally join the African Continental Free Trade area to ensure that it benefits from increased intra-African trade. Eritrea’s education commitments are reflected in the National Policy on Education, Education Plan (2023-2027)  and the Strategic Plan to Expand Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE), all of which seek to broaden access to quality education. However, these goals must be matched with financial investment in the sector by increasing resource allocation, prudence in utilization of resources and engaging more donors for additional financing. Increased investment in education should be characterised by renewed focus on gender equality to enhance learner retention, addressing climate vulnerability, training teachers and reducing the student-teacher ratio. At the same time, the country must end child marriage, end forced conscription of students and teachers, and address access and drop-out rates including improving transition from primary to secondary school. This would facilitate the implementation of its education plans and policies.   Every year, our global community comes together to fight injustice and support people whose human rights are under threat.

They are people.’",AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2024/06/oday-over-600-people-drowned-in-the-pylos-shipwreck-including-my-brother-they-are-not-numbers-they-are-people/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? Oday is a Syrian man who lives in the UK. His brothers Mohammed and Riyadh fled Syria to Europe. They ended up on the “Adriana”, an overcrowded trawler that left Libya with an estimated 750 people from Syria, Pakistan and Egypt onboard, before sinking off the coast of Pylos, Greece, on 14 June 2023. Oday’s brother Mohammed survived, but Riyadh died. Survivors told Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch that the Greek Coast Guard towed the boat with a rope, causing it to capsize. Afterwards, rescue attempts were slow. Only 104 people survived. One year after the shipwreck, Oday recounts his experiences and calls out for justice and accountability. My name is Oday Al Talab. I had two brothers, Mohammed and Riyadh, but Riyadh died in the Pylos shipwreck. In my city in Syria, Daraa, I worked as a journalist. Snipers of the regime shot me twice because of my media activity in Syria, where I was documenting violations against civilians. Due to my health and continuous targeting by the regime, I left Syria. I consider our situation one of displacement. We were displaced in Daraa because they [the Syrian authorities] bombarded our homes and neighborhoods. My brothers left Syria because of this. They also reached the age of compulsory military service and did not want to join the regime’s army. The choices for young people in Syria are death, migration or displacement. When I first heard about the shipwreck, I had no information about whether this was the ship that my brothers were on, but I knew there was a high possibility it was. I immediately arranged my journey to Kalamata, Greece, where they had brought the survivors and the drowned. I went to the hospital, then to the coast guard. They didn’t give any further details about the incident. The suffering continued as I went between the coast guard, the police and the hospital, then back to the coast guard. They eventually shared a list with the names of 104 survivors of different nationalities. I searched for my brothers’ names. I found Mohammed. I asked about my other brother, Riyadh. They said they did not have any information about him. They told me: “We will take you to see your brother, but you’re not allowed to ask him about your other brother or ask him certain questions. You are not allowed to cry. You will see him for one minute or less.” When they took me to see him, there was an iron fence separating us. “Where is Riyadh?” Mohammed immediately asked me. I asked him the same question. He could not control himself, he started crying. His face was bruised from what he had endured. The police took him inside, back to a warehouse not suitable for animals, let alone human beings. They wouldn’t let me console my brother.   Many people from Daraa were on the ship that sank. Many Syrian families contacted me to find out about the fate of their children who were on board. I started helping them by asking information about their family members. From the list of survivors, we singled out the Syrian names and their families were contacted. They were reassured that their children were alive. For those whose names we couldn’t find, their situation was the same as my missing brother. The Greek authorities treated us very badly. They said there were 82 bodies, but they wouldn’t give us any more information even though we are the relatives of those who died. To identify bodies, I gave a DNA sample in Kalamata, along with details about my lost brother, including his height and weight, age, a picture of him, distinctive marks, everything. The next day I went to Athens to search the hospitals, to ask about the bodies, to find information about the fate of my lost brother. I was told that the 104 survivors were transferred to a camp near Athens. I went and asked to see my brother Mohammed again. There were many families and relatives of the victims and survivors there too. The authorities told us that the waiting time was long. I asked the camp manager if they could allow all the family members from Daraa to enter the camp together, to be given one hour to see the Syrian survivors. The request was accepted. We had procured some supplies for the survivors, at our own expense: mobiles with internet connection, clothes, food, personal care items. We saw some Syrian survivors still wearing the same clothes they wore when the boat sank. A young man was covering his body with a blanket because he didn’t have any clothes. On our fourth day in Greece, I asked the coast guard if anyone had been rescued, other than the 104 survivors. They said “no”. At that point, anyone still missing was dead. This is being logical; this is being honest. We lost hope of finding the missing. Based on the information we had, we announced the death of my younger brother Riyadh. A week after returning to the UK I received an email from the Greek authorities telling me that my brother Riyadh’s body had been identified and to contact them for funeral arrangements. Even when I told the Greek authorities I wanted Riyadh to be buried in Greece, they repeatedly told me to contact the Syrian embassy. I refused to do so. Being from an opposition family, we do not recognize the Syrian regime, and we do not deal with it. I was finally told that the burial could take place in Greece, but there is no Islamic cemetery in Athens. The Greek authorities told me they would not cover the costs of an Islamic burial. I had to take care of the burial myself. When they released Riyadh’s body, I travelled back to Greece and reached out to a Muslim funeral service company. We collected my brother’s body from a mortuary fridge in Athens and we buried Riyadh in a Muslim cemetery eight hours away from Athens. If the Greek authorities have the bodies and data of those who died, how is it possible that not allthe bodies have been returned to their families after one year? This is wrong. We want justice. We want those responsible to be held accountable. I started the “Justice for the Boat Victims” initiative [an online campaign in support of victims and families of the shipwreck]. The campaign assisted families of the missing with the search for their relatives. We made calls to NGOs and media outlets, posted photos and information. We created a WhatsApp group for the families of the victims so they could communicate, and we advised them on how to communicate with the Red Cross and Red Crescent and how to conduct DNA tests. We helped survivors connect with lawyers. Based on witness testimony, the Greek authorities were involved in the sinking of the boat. We want justice and accountability. Over 500 of the people drowned remain at sea. They are not numbers. They had dreams, they had families, and they had rights. They had a right to live.

Amnesty International has launched Age Loud! Demand a world where human rights last a lifetime, a new campaign calling on all of us to listen to the voices of older people and ensure respect for their fundamental rights. As a global human rights movement, Amnesty International is dedicated to ensuring that human rights are enjoyed by everyone. But during our investigations around the world, we’ve often found that as people grow older, their rights are disregarded and their dignity undermined. For too long, older people have been seen not as rights-holders, but as the subjects of the charity or medical sectors. That’s why Amnesty International is embracing the cause of older people’s rights. Age Loud! aims to change attitudes and inspire people of all ages to demand an end to age-related discrimination, neglect and abuse. Collaborating with Amnesty International’s national offices and a diverse range of activists, allies and organizations around the world, our campaign will amplify the voices of older people and aim to rewrite the narrative around ageing. Laura Mills, Amnesty International’s Researcher on Age and Disability, said: “Our new campaign defies the notion of ageing in silence and asserts that growing older does not diminish our rights. We are advocating for an older age where people are empowered to speak up for their rights, and where governments are compelled to listen and to act.” To date, there is no dedicated international treaty protecting the rights of older people. However, United Nations member states recently adopted a momentous decision identifying gaps in the protection of the human rights of older people by recommending, among other measures, a new international convention. “Older people often experience ageism and age discrimination, fuelled by negative stereotypes that they are somehow less valuable, weak or dependent on others. As a consequence, we have found that their rights are often less protected in many areas of daily life, leaving them at greater risk of violence, poverty, and neglect,” said Laura Mills. “The recent decision at the UN is the start of a journey to finally ensure that older people’s rights are adequately protected, but now member states must take concrete steps to ensure that drafting of a convention can begin. This is an issue that will one day affect all of us, and if we want to grow older with rights ourselves, we must do everything in our power to ensure better protection for older people today.” For more information, please visit our page about our work on older people’s rights.

0,Aisia: “I am a young transwoman from the Philippines – activism comes naturally”,AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2024/06/aisia-i-am-a-young-transwoman-from-the-philippines-activism-comes-naturally/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? Growing up, Aisia Castelo, 24, from the Philippines, struggled to understand her identity as a young transgender woman. Now, through her activism, she’s determined to raise her voice, share her story and make sure other young people can safely access the resources they need online, without the threat of abuse or harassment. “It was hard growing up in the Philippines, especially when I was trying to figure out my life and my identity. When I was younger, we didn’t have the resources that other people have now, especially as a transperson. I wanted to start hormones, but I had no idea how to access them. I thought I might be transfeminine, but I didn’t know what to do next. I never had the language for it, until I was 18 – that was the first time I saw the term transgender and thought, ‘That could be me.’ Growing up in the province meant we lacked so many resources. Medical advice on the issue was unavailable, so I couldn’t just book a doctor’s consultation. I had to seek out other trans people and communities for answers and ask what hormones to take. Tik Tok and Instagram let me access the information I lacked. However, the resources were not always accurate, and it meant people could take the wrong pills as the medication is largely unregulated. As well as medical risks, I faced abuse and harassment while I was coming to terms with my identity. I went to a Catholic high school, where I wasn’t allowed to have long hair and I had to dress as a male. By the time I was ready to graduate, I had started playing with my femininity and playfully cross dressing. I was around 15 or 16, when I finally felt comfortable in who I was. By the time it came to our version of prom, I felt ready to dress as a girl. When I got to school, I put on my wig, a skin-tight dress, a kimono I stole from my mum, and a crown. When the discipline officer saw me, they pulled me aside and told me if I wanted to join the party, I would have to go home and get changed. I was so embarrassed – I was on my knees, crying to my advisor, saying “What is this? Why do I have to go through this?’ As a young trans person in the Philippines with so many restrictions, I couldn’t live my authentic life. My right to enjoy school life, as myself, was stripped away – that’s why I am advocating for my rights now. Luckily, my family was supportive. My older sister is trans, so she carried the burden of coming out to the family. My mum bought me my first pair of knickers. It was such a full circle moment – I was lucky to have that support in my family, but that’s not to say life on the outside was easy. As a young person, I had so much confidence. I was excited to go out and wear my wig, a crop top and my skirt – I wanted to live in this delusional world, where I could be who I wanted to be. But as a young person, I didn’t have the language to convey the experiences that followed, whether that was abuse or harassment. I studied psychology at university, and I remember taking the bus home after a volunteer shift at the transgender clinic. It was past 11pm and my province was two hours away. I felt like a confident woman with my wig, full make up, heels, when suddenly a random man sat next to me and started kissing me. At that moment, I didn’t understand what was happening, I thought my womanhood was being validated, so I was like, ‘OK, he sees me as a girl, he thinks I am sexy and hot.’ But I look back on it now and realise that I was sexually abused on a bus, and I didn’t even know it. I didn’t know how to label those things. As young trans woman from the Philippines, activism has come naturally to me. However, the atmosphere in my country is making it hard to speak out. Red-tagging has become prevalent and if you’re someone who believes in human rights, you’re tagged as a threat to society or a national terrorist. Young people have been red-tagged online and their personal information leaked across Facebook. People are missing because the national police have taken them. That’s the sad reality of activism in the Philippines. It’s engrained in our culture. I have grown up in an unkind world. As well as violence and abuse, I have experienced hate, bullying and censorship because of my public advocacy. Last year, I was part of a social movement around election time. Instagram removed my posts because they ‘violated community guidelines’, but I keep going despite the dangers. If you stand up for something, you’re not a threat to national security. But for that to change, we need to change the way activism is seen in the Philippines. Although I am at risk, I am trying my best to support other young people through my activism. During the elections last year, I was part of the large social movement where I met so many young people – many who weren’t legal to vote – volunteering their time. As I was a little older than them, I became their ‘mother’. I would share advice with them about gender identity. They were aware of my public advocacy online, especially as a transgender woman. They would ask about clinics and hormone replacement therapy and thank me for being informative. Ninety percent of young people in the Philippines are online, so it was good to meet other young activists in person. While the digital space is accessible to young people it is having a dangerous impact on our wellbeing. Many of the bigger platforms allow hate to thrive, because they make money from it. It makes it harder for us to exist online as we don’t have access to safety protocols that protect us and let us enjoy our own digital rights. Recently, I have been working with Amnesty International on its new youth led project, RIGHTS CLICK, which is enabling children and young people to co-create online platforms and other digital technologies that protect their rights – and their health and well-being. As part of the project, we are listening to young peoples’ stories and learning about the challenges they face, so we can provide solutions together. It’s sad that we are forced to speak out and bear the burden of being an activist – but this project is building a community of activists who are working together to build a safer digital world. I want to speak out. If I don’t, how will other generations hear our experiences and how will the system change? It needs come from us. There are laws that are made for transwomen, made by cis gender people – it doesn’t make sense. We know what we need. I won’t be silenced, in person or online.” Every year, our global community comes together to fight injustice and support people whose human rights are under threat.

0,In the shadow of industries in Congo,AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2024/06/in-the-shadow-of-industries-in-congo/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? Republic of Congo’s coastline is the centre of the country’s industrial activity. Oil – the country’s main source of revenue – is extracted and exported from here, as are other raw materials like potash, phosphate and gold. Businesses recycling waste from other countries also have been increasing their operations here (as elsewhere in Africa, after the tightening of regulations in countries such as India and China). Unfortunately, the Congolese laws meant to oversee the operations of these companies are often not well enforced. This leaves communities living around the country’s economic hub vulnerable to the effects of these industries on their environment, health and livelihoods. They also continue to face deprivation, including serious water shortages and poor healthcare. Watch the video and find out how residents of Vindoulou, a neighbourhood in Pointe-Noire, are fighting against a waste management company operating just next to a primary school in their community. Congo often presents itself as a champion of environmental protection. The country has various conservation programmes for the Congo Basin Forest and a strong framework of environmental laws, including a 2009 decree requiring companies to carry out environmental impact assessments before they can operate, and the 2023 Sustainable Environmental Management Act. Once companies are authorised to operate, the State is supposed to undertake quarterly assessments to monitor the companies’ compliance with environmental laws, and to take action if they are not compliant.  Congolese law also requires companies responsible for environmental damage to restore ecosystems and to compensate affected people. Under international law and standards, companies have the responsibility to respect human rights, and States must also ensure that companies act responsibly, in line with their environmental and human rights obligations.    VS While such laws and international obligations and standards exist in principle, putting them into practice is another matter. Amnesty International’s research into industries in the regions of Pointe-Noire and Kouilou found that environmental impact assessments are not always carried out. Even when they do take place, they are often not made public, so remain largely inaccessible despite people’s ‘right to information’ guaranteed by international human rights treaties. Communities are all too often kept in the dark about the full impact of the industries on their environment, livelihoods and health. Our research focused on cases of two oil companies and one recycling company operating around the communities of Djeno, Vindoulou and Banga Kayo, affecting their land, water and air. Our research also highlights how the State and the companies have failed to uphold their international and national obligations in these settings, and how people’s human rights have been violated as a result.   Amnesty International research demonstrates that in the shadow of the industries that generate the wealth of the country, people are suffering both from environmental pollution and violations to their rights to water and health.   Among many recommendations to address this situation, Amnesty International calls on the Congo government to: More specifically regarding the cases highlighted in our report, Amnesty International calls on the Congo government to: Amnesty International urges the companies operating in Congo to respect human rights in line with international standards, including the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. This means ensuring that their operations do not cause or contribute to the harming of human rights. They must be transparent about the potential impacts of their operations and the measures they take to mitigate those impacts; and provide effective remedy to anyone harmed by their operations. More generally, Amnesty International urges the Congo government to adopt and implement a just transition plan to phase out the production of oil and gas in a manner compatible with the human rights of the population of Congo, including workers and communities relying on fossil fuels extraction. As Amnesty International highlights in its Fatal Fuels report, fossil fuel extraction all too often harms nearby communities and contributes to the suppression of rights to freedom of expression, association and assembly in the country concerned, as well as contributing to the climate crisis. Targets should be set for reducing production by 2030 and the full phase-out should be completed no later than 2050, in line with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change evidence.

The country’s only oil terminal, managed by Total-Energy Congo (a subsidiary of the French oil company Total-Energy) is located in the small fishing village of Djeno. An oil terminal is used to receive, process and store crude oil from many different sites before it is sent to refineries by tanker or pipeline. The oil terminal at Djeno processes more than 95% of Congolese crude oil production (roughly 257,000 barrels of oil per day in 2022). Djeno residents have raised complaints about the impact of the oil terminal on their economic, social and environmental rights since it was built in 1972. Over the years, communities, NGOs and scientists have reported spills of crude oil polluting the soil and the water of the Loubi Lagoon, on which communities depended for their livelihoods. Indeed, since the oil spills, residents report that the numbers of fish in the lagoon have dropped and their quality is poor. Fish were previously the main source of food and income for the community, and many have no choice but to continue eating them. Total-Energies Congo has never communicated publicly on these incidents of pollution, nor on any measures taken to remedy them. Frustrated by the company’s lack of transparency and action, an NGO named Association Jeunesse pour la Vie au Kouilou (AJVK) took the company to court in 2016. In 2019 the court ordered Total-Energy to pay damages of approximately US$85,000 for ‘moral damage’ and US$250,000 for environmental damage to the community association that had filed the complaint. The company was also ordered to resume clean-up operations in the Loubi Lagoon and to restore the ecosystem destroyed by the spills. On 28 February 2020, the Pointe-Noire Court of Appeal suspended enforcement of the initial judgement. AJVK’s president died in 2021, and no one has taken over the case. Some cleaning operations were undertaken in 2020, but people from Djeno say these were not done properly. The Pointe-Noire environmental authorities said the clean-up was conducted in line with procedure, but also noted that crude oil remained in areas of long grass. They reported asking the company to resume cleaning in those areas, but to date, Amnesty International has been unable to obtain proof of this request.  According to Total-Energies, two separate laboratories tested the water in 2021, and declared the quality of the water in the Lagoon to be ‘good’. The company also states that the lack of fish could be due to other factors, such as other industries present in the area, or industrial fishing. However, the communities still report that the fish now taste of petrol and eating them leaves people with stomach problems and diarrhoea.

0,Poor access to healthcare and water in Tchicanou and Bondi: “There are no doctors there…”,AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2024/06/poor-access-to-healthcare-and-water-in-tchicanou-and-bondi-there-are-no-doctors-there/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? In the villages of Tchicanou, Bondi and Kouakoula, Amnesty International research found that access to water and health remains very limited for residents, despite pledges to provide them from both companies and the state. All the villages under study in Amnesty International’s research benefited from the State ‘Water for All’ programme. However, at the time of Amnesty International’s visit, the initiative’s facilities were no longer functioning. According to residents, no maintenance had been provided and the solar panels used to power the pump had reportedly been stolen. Previously, communities would get water from various natural sources. But with the arrival of oil companies and a gravel factory, the water appears to have dried up or become unsafe to drink. Residents interviewed by Amnesty International in Tchicanou, Bondi and Kouakoula said that as early as 2006, oil company officials held meetings with them to advise against drinking water from the river, though this instruction and the reasons for the decision were not issued in writing. The oil company that took over extraction in 2007 – ENI Congo – also got involved in supplying water to these three villages. The company installed deep boreholes of several dozen metres in 2017 and 2018. But this system also had shortcomings, with pumps breaking down regularly. The company then provided a generator to power a pump; every two days the generator is dropped off in a village in the area, so that it can build up stocks of water, and the oil company also organises water distribution by tanker. Thus, even while Congo has abundant water resources, and a government that has ratified human rights treaties guaranteeing the right to water, communities are left with non-functioning State water infrastructure, and non-drinkable natural water. The situation is similar in terms of health provision. The M’Bokou Integrated Health Centre covers the villages of Bondi and Tchicanou and several others in the surrounding area, i.e. one centre for just over 7,000 people. The centre was rehabilitated by ENI-Congo as part of a social project. However, the health centre services are limited. At the time of Amnesty International’s visit, no doctors were assigned to the centre; it had just one midwife, three community workers and four ‘community liaison officers’. There was no laboratory technician assigned to the health centre, and the laboratory, which had previously been renovated by the company, was no longer functioning. Finally, access to the centre is challenging: the rocky road is difficult to travel on, especially during the rainy season when it is in poor condition. Residents told us that they had to travel to Pointe-Noire, 40km from the village, to actually see doctors when they are ill and pay for medicines there, because hardly anything is available at the health centre.    As with water provision, the State must invest more in public services to ensure people’s right to access healthcare, rather than outsourcing its obligations to companies. In a response letter to Amnesty International, Metssa Congo denied any toxic nature of its emission of fumes thanks to its “cutting-edge control equipment”. Metssa Congo also said that the smoke was actually from the aluminium furnace, and unrelated to the lead furnace production. The company also claimed that they have all the legal documents to operate in Congo. The collective of residents of Vindoulou filed a complaint in June 2023 to the Pointe-Noire High Court requesting the suspension and the relocation of the Metssa factory, along with reparations.

0,"Factory fumes in the neighbourhood of Vindoulou: “Children regularly vomit and cough a lot, especially when there is a lot of smoke.”",AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2024/06/factory-fumes-in-the-neighbourhood-of-vindoulou-children-regularly-vomit-and-cough-a-lot-especially-when-there-is-a-lot-of-smoke/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? In the neighbourhood of Vindoulou, in the suburbs of Pointe-Noire, residents have long sounded the alarm about a factory owned by Metssa Congo, a subsidiary of the Indian group Metssa. The factory, which recycles used batteries and industrial products containing lead and aluminium, emits smoke daily into the air around people’s homes. It is in the middle of the neighbourhood, just 50m from a large school. Residents fear for their health: they have always reported frequent headaches and stomach aches, as well as noise pollution and environmental damage from the dust and fumes. “Children regularly vomit and cough a lot, especially when there is a lot of smoke,” reported one resident. A teacher said: “The children are breathing these fumes; it stings their eyes and throats. Sometimes we have to take them out of classes to allow them to breathe better and give them water.” As a result of the residents’ complaints, and the absence of an environmental impact assessment and proper authorization to operate, the factory was closed by the regional Prefect in August 2020. The company paid for clinical examinations for residents during the closure, but the results of the various tests were not shared with them thereafter. Metssa Congo claims that it was “not authorized by the government to publicize the findings” of the health surveys but said that an audit had confirmed there were ‘no long-term risks to those residing in close proximity to our plant’. It said it ‘verbally communicated these results to the concerned individuals who approached us’. The residents’ collective denies this.  In November 2020, the Ministry of Environment sent a letter authorising the company to resume operations, but noting that it must complete the steps to bring the site in line with environmental standards within a period of three months. Essentially, the Ministry recognised that the company did not have the necessary certificate of environmental compliance or authorisation to open, but nevertheless authorised it to resume its operations. No further information was shared thereafter on any measures taken by the company to comply with environmental regulations. In March 2023, following an initiative undertaken by a collective of residents, blood samples were taken from 18 people living near the factory, including eight children. The tests showed that all 18 people had extremely high levels of lead in their blood. There is no level of lead concentration in the blood considered to be safe, but according to WHO (World Health Organization) guidelines, a concentration of 50 micrograms of lead per litre in the blood is the value at which clinical interventions should be initiated. Continued exposure to lead causes a range of gastrointestinal, hematological, and neurological disorders, especially in young children. Yet the levels measured in the Vindoulou residents ranged from 263 to 551 micrograms per litre, including for a 14-month-old baby—up to 11 times the WHO threshold. In a response letter to Amnesty International, Metssa Congo denied any toxic nature of its emission of fumes thanks to its “cutting-edge control equipment”. Metssa Congo also said that the smoke was actually from the aluminium furnace, and unrelated to the lead furnace production.

0,The Rana Plaza collapse and Tazreen Fashions Fire: An interview with Taqbir Huda,AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2024/06/the-rana-plaza-collapse-and-tazreen-fashions-fire-an-interview-with-taqbir-huda/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? Eleven years after two of the deadliest cases of corporate negligence in Bangladesh — the Rana Plaza collapse and Tazreen Fashions Fire — garment workers who suffered permanent injuries while assembling clothes sold by leading global fashion labels have yet to receive justice. Occupational safety for most Bangladeshi workers also remains a distant dream. In recent times, fires in the BM Container Depot on 4 June 2022 and the Hashem Foods Factory on 7 July 2021 killed almost 100 factory workers due to the employer’s alleged negligence and non-compliance with safety standards. In this interview, Taqbir Huda, Amnesty International’s regional researcher for South Asia, speaks with Nazia Erum, Amnesty International’s media manager, on his pursuit of corporate accountability and justice for workers in his home country Bangladesh. I still remember the 24 April 2013, when an eight-storey building named Rana Plaza collapsed killing 1,100 workers and injuring 2,600 others. The building housed numerous garment factories catering to major Western retail brands. I was sleeping comfortably under my duvet, while thousands of workers lied underneath the rubble, less than an hour away from me. Thousands killed and injured simply because their employers chose to ignore the large structural cracks that appeared in the building and forced workers who feared for their life to continue producing clothes. Western buyer deadlines had to be met. The Rana Plaza collapse came exactly five months after the deadly fire in Tazreen Fashions Factory, on 24 November 2012, where at least 112 workers died and scores more were injured while locked up inside the factory. One survivor told me “The only means of escaping the fire was jumping out of the windows on upper floors. Look at how my nails have stopped growing back after I had to use them to claw out of the window.” They told me about other lifelong injuries they sustained due to the fall, while many of their relatives and colleagues burnt to death before they could escape. Many from the same family worked inside the factory together. Both these acts of corporate negligence and impunity exposed the human cost of unregulated corporate greed and reinforced the need for international standards on business and human rights. I knew then, as I know how, we must change this status quo. As a Bangladeshi and a labour rights activist, it bothers me to no end when people refer to Rana Plaza and Tazreen as unfortunate tragedies, as this obfuscates how companies failed to ensure safe working conditions. We must view them through the lens of corporate impunity. The lack of accountability after both atrocities highlighted the disregard for workers’ lives not only by the factories but also by the high-end brands they died making clothes for. It was even more infuriating to see Canadian and American courts swiftly dismiss compensation cases filed against these brands that had sourced clothes from factories inside Rana Plaza, on narrow technical grounds. On the other hand, a group of local NGOs led by the Bangladesh Legal Aid and Services Trust had filed compensation cases for both Rana Plaza and Tazreen in the Supreme Court. These cases continue to be ongoing even after a decade after being filed. Earlier this year, I was relieved to see that a hearing date had come up for the Rana Plaza case and worked closely with the legal team to make legal submissions to the court. However, the case has now been adjourned again. I often think of Sokina, a survivor of Tazreen, who shared her story with me: “The doctor told me, ‘As long as I am alive, I will need to seek treatment for my leg’, which I had broken when I had to jump from the fourth floor. The relief payment I had received from the fund that was set up with brand donations is long gone, while we are yet to receive compensation from the employer. My son studies in fifth grade and I cannot even afford to buy the books he needs for school. I have to rely on my elderly mother’s income. I had moved to Dhaka to find work to become economically solvent and now I am forever destitute.” It was harrowing for me to see her break down as she expressed her frustration. I had no words to console her. Sokina and other Tazreen survivors still call me from time to time, hoping I may offer some words of hope. But I have none to offer. The Bangladesh Accord, a legally binding agreement between brands, unions and factories significantly improved occupational safety for over two million garment factory workers in Bangladesh. On the other hand, it pains me to see almost daily reports of workers deaths or injuries in other, non-export-oriented sectors in Bangladesh, where occupational safety remains a distant dream. Employers do not have to appease pressure from Western buyer-brands to ensure safety. It was heartbreaking to meet young workers from the shipyard and construction industries who had their lives turned upside down after becoming permanently disabled. It was even more heartbreaking to meet the family members of workers killed on their jobs.  Since the price of a dead worker in Bangladesh is less than £2,000, unregulated profit maximising entities have little to no incentive to invest in occupational safety. Conservative estimates by the Safety and Rights Society has recorded 5,608 worker deaths between 2013 and 2023. This excludes the death toll from the Rana Plaza collapse. Therefore, even based on this conservative estimate, at least one worker continues to die each day on average in mostly preventable workplace ‘accidents’ in Bangladesh after Rana Plaza. According to Bangladesh’s labour law, employers are only required to pay 250,000 BDT (1,860 GBP) for workers permanently injured in an “industrial accident” at their workplace. For those killed in the workplace the amount of compensation payable to their dependents is even lower at 200,000 BDT (1,500 GBP). When I first began researching on labour rights, I was shocked to see how little value is attached to a worker’s life by the very law that was meant to “ensure labour rights”. Despite such an arbitrary limit on the amount of compensation, from my analysis of labour court cases I found that employers often refuse to even pay this tiny sum. One labour court lawyer explained to me, that the strategy is to ‘tire out the workers until they no longer have the energy to continue the case. These employers would rather spend more money in prolonging the case, than simply paying the limited compensation because the worker had the audacity to sue them’. Even when a compensation award is made after a lengthy trial, corporations seldom comply with the court order, leaving many survivors and/or their families without any compensation at all. Real change can only take place when the real problem is acknowledged, which is that corporations continue to adopt labour exploitation as part of a standard business model.   We at Amnesty International have been advocating for corporate accountability in Bangladesh (including occupational safety for all workers) through detailed research and targeted campaigning, such as with the UN Human Rights Council. Labour justice was a core component of the human rights charter we published ahead of Bangladesh’s last general elections. One of our key recommendations to the government of Bangladesh is the establishment of a national database that records every time a worker is killed or maimed due to workplace conditions. The repository should provide details about all workplace injuries and deaths in any given year, alongside the compensation claims filed in all Labour Courts with their outcomes. Additionally, the labour law should be amended so victims receive rights-based compensation for workplace injuries or deaths that remedies the full extent of their losses in line with international standards. We work closely with partners on the ground fighting for labour rights in Bangladesh, such as by assisting with legal research for the Rana Plaza compensation case before the Supreme Court. We have issued a public statement with a range of recommendations to the Bangladeshi government on upholding labour justice. We have recently documented the climate of repression faced by garment workers amid a state-sanctioned crackdown on those who defend workers’ rights in Bangladesh.  We will continue pushing for accountability and reform so workers can realise the full extent of their human rights.

In April 1989, university students in Beijing gathered in Tiananmen Square to draw up a list of demands broadly centred on political and economic reforms, but also including calls for an end to corruption, censorship and limits on basic rights. In the weeks that followed, their demands drew wide public support, from pensioners to veterans to farmers. Millions joined peaceful demonstrations that took place across China. The Chinese authorities failed to persuade the demonstrators to return home. As tensions escalated in Beijing, martial law was declared on 20 May 1989. On the night of 3 June 1989, heavily armed troops and hundreds of armoured vehicles moved into the city centre to ‘clear’ the pro-democracy demonstrators from Tiananmen Square. An official report issued by the Chinese authorities at the end of June 1989 claimed that “more than 3,000 civilians were wounded and over 200, including 36 college students, died during the riot”. The report also stated that several dozen soldiers died. While the exact figures remain unknown, the official figure for deaths is likely a serious under-reporting. Relatives of victims, survivors and human rights defenders who have come together as the Tiananmen Mothers have, despite severe threats and intimidation, collected their own tally of fatalities and call every year for the government to provide a full account and acknowledgement. Immediately after the military crackdown, the authorities began to hunt down those involved in the demonstrations. Many civilians were detained, tortured, or imprisoned after unfair trials. Many were charged with ‘counter-revolutionary’ crimes. In the 35 years since the crackdown, all discussion of the incident has been heavily censored in China, as authorities have effectively attempted to erase it from history. Public commemoration or mere mention, online or off, of the Tiananmen crackdown is banned.  Regularly since 1989, activists in mainland China have been detained and charged with “subversion” or “picking quarrels” if they commemorate those who were killed, call for the release of prisoners or criticize government actions during the Tiananmen crackdown. The government has never accepted responsibility for the human rights violations during and after the military crackdown or held any perpetrator accountable. With each year that passes, justice becomes ever more elusive.  Commemorating the Tiananmen crackdown has long been forbidden in mainland China. However, every year on 4 June from 1990 to 2019, up to hundreds of thousands of people joined a candlelight vigil in Hong Kong’s Victoria Park to remember those killed. They called on the Chinese authorities to reveal the truth about what happened and accept accountability for the fatalities.  The vigil was banned in 2020 and 2021, ostensibly on Covid-19 grounds, and since then repressive new laws such as the 2020 National Security Law have effectively criminalized peaceful protest in the city. Every year the vigil in Hong Kong featured a recorded message from the Tiananmen Mothers, who are still seeking a full government account of the deaths, lawful compensation and investigation of criminal responsibility. The Hong Kong Tiananmen vigil was organized for 30 years by the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China (Hong Kong Alliance). Alliance vice-chairperson Chow Hang-tung and 25 activists were prosecuted in 2020 simply because they insisted on lighting candles in Victoria Park despite the government prohibiting the vigil that year, ostensibly on Covid-19 grounds. In 2021, after the police banned the vigil once again, Chow was arrested on 4 June after encouraging people on social media to commemorate the crackdown by lighting candles.  Ultimately, Chow was jailed for 22 months for taking part and inciting others to take part in an unauthorised assembly. She and fellow Hong Kong Alliance leaders Lee Cheuk Yan and Albert Ho have also been charged with “inciting subversion” under the National Security Law and all three face a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.  Amnesty International has continually demanded justice for those killed or unjustly jailed in the Tiananmen crackdown 35 years ago, and for those who have been targeted for commemorating it in the years since. Despite the authorities’ suppression of any activism related to the crackdown, people in Hong Kong, in mainland China, and across the world continue to fight for the right to freedom of peaceful assembly in China. Once again, on this 4 June, Amnesty will stand with them to commemorate the anniversary. Show solidarity with Tiananmen protesters past and present by demanding action from the Chinese and Hong Kong governments. You too can join the commemoration by signing our petition and using our “Remembering Tiananmen Square” Instagram filter. Together, we can show them that the world is still watching, and that the horror of Tiananmen will never be forgotten.

Despite regional and international calls for an independent and impartial investigation into the unlawful killing of Thulani Maseko, Thulani’s family and community remain far from attaining justice for him.   by signing and delivering the #500 days postcard to your Ministers of Foreign Relations and Eswatini High Commissions, demanding justice for Thulani Maseko.  Eswatini (formerly Swaziland) is Africa’s last absolute monarchy. It has been ruled by King Mswati III since 1986, together with his mother Queen Mother Ntombi (who is seen as the spiritual head, Mswati is the administrative head). Eswatini’s monarchy is strongly opposed to political reform and activism.   Repressive laws and excessive state violence have long been used to silence peaceful protest in the Kingdom of Eswatini. Protesters, dissenters, journalists, and human rights defenders and people who are critical of the monarchy have been and continue to be subjected to arbitrary detention, torture and other ill-treatment, and criminal prosecution, particularly because of the protests for democratic reforms sparked in 2021.   Thulani chaired the Multi-Stakeholders Forum, a coalition of political parties and civil society groups formed in August 2021 to call for democratic reform in the country.  Thulani Maseko was a brave human rights defender, lawyer and prominent activist in Eswatini who used his voice to speak out against human rights violations and the oppression of the people of Eswatini until his death in January 2023.    #500days Week of Action campaign , begining on June 4 and concluding on 7 June 2024, marks a significant milestone since the killing of Thulani Maseko. Its primary goal is to rally activists worldwide, urging them to mobilize and engage with Ministers of Foreign Relations/Policy in their respective nations and Eswatini High Commissions  The objective of this campaign is to demand decisive action and accountability regarding the stagnant investigation into the brutal killing of Thulani Maseko.  We encourage you to sign and deliver postcard to your Ministry of Foreign Affairs/Relations and to send copies to your ambassadors in the Kingdom of Eswatini.   The expected outcome is heightened and coordinated pressure among foreign governments through their diplomatic missions in Eswatini officials to prioritize the issue in their engagement with the Eswatini government.   If you are talented and passionate about human rights then Amnesty International wants to hear from you. © 2024 Amnesty International","['\nAfrica\n', '\nCampaign\n', '\nCampaigns\n', '\nEswatini\n', '\nHuman Rights Defenders and Activists\n', '\nSouthern Africa\n', '\nUnlawful Killings\n']",,False

0,TJ Riggs: “It’s difficult to watch Alabama continue to kill people and to do it so mercilessly and so often”,AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2024/05/tj-riggs-its-difficult-to-watch-alabama-continue-to-kill-people-and-to-do-it-so-mercilessly-and-so-often/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? Twenty-year-old TJ Riggs is a student at Samford University and Amnesty International’s Death Penalty Abolition Coordinator for the State of Alabama. He talks about his passion for fighting on behalf of those on death row, racial justice in the US state and how the simple act of writing a letter can make a difference to someone who has been sentenced to death. In my freshman year of college at Samford University, I was tasked with taking over our chapter of Amnesty International. It had mostly died out during the pandemic and I spent my year as president increasing membership and engaging in different youth campaigns. That was my first foray into Amnesty. Student groups do all sorts of different activism. I really got involved and plugged into the Alabama death penalty network. After that initial year of being president of the student chapter, I was asked to apply and serve in the role of Amnesty’s Alabama State Death Penalty Abolition Coordinator. Now, I lead all of AIUSA’s death penalty work in the State of Alabama, and work with a national network of other state leaders and Amnesty staff to advance our cause both locally and nationally. Change doesn’t happen without the public calling for it, and without people pushing for it. Especially in a state like Alabama, which has such an intense history of racial oppression and marginalization, but also played such a prominent role in the fight for civil rights in the USA. I think that given the history of our State, it is clear that activism is key to informing and driving public opinion. And I think that driving public opinion is key to creating real change. House Bill 27 was a piece of legislation that, if passed, would have made Alabama’s 2017 ban on judicial override retroactive. Judicial override is the process through which a judge can give a death sentence even when the jury has voted for life without parole. It was banned in 2017 but the new law was not applied to those who were already under sentence of death. House Bill 27 would have made the ban retroactive, and 33 people who are currently sitting on death row would have their sentences changed to life without parole, which is what the juries in their trials had voted for. I, along with an incredible team of Amnesty staff members, organized the rally in partnership with the Alabama chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union in support of House Bill 27. The point of the rally was to support House Bill 27 and deliver the petition signatures and actions from around the world to urge clemency for Rocky Myers, which was an Alabama-specific case in the Write for Rights campaign. We had speakers from the State House and other local activist groups present for the delivery, and the Write for Rights petitions were handed over to the Governor’s office by Rocky’s son. Unfortunately, House Bill 27 failed a couple weeks later. It was voted down in the subcommittee, directly along party lines. With that being said, I think that we definitely made some strides making the people of Alabama aware, active, and mobilized on the issue. It’s absolutely heartbreaking. I think it’s important to continue to be cognizant of the fact that people’s lives are at stake and that when an execution happens, it’s not just a political event that happens in a vacuum. It comes at the expense of someone’s life and of the people around them; their families, their brothers and sisters on death row itself. We hear so many stories of family members of victims and jurors on cases living with deep regret about how these executions turned out.  It’s definitely pretty upsetting to see on an individual level. I talk to his son on the phone maybe about once a month, just to keep up with him and see that he’s doing well.I mean, his father’s been in jail at this point for 30 years.I think everyone who was at the rally  would agree that hearing him speak was really powerful. He called Rocky, his father, his hero. He said he stays hopeful and that Rocky stays hopeful for himself and for his family. For a year I worked on a smorgasbord of Amnesty International policies that student groups tend to work on. And I found that the death penalty action really resonated with me. I think specifically in Alabama too, we really are in a uniquely bad state for executions, especially recently in terms of both legislation and in terms of process. There are things happening in this state that weren’t happening in other states, and Alabama is changing the norm on capital punishment in a way that unfortunately is being modelled by other state governments. It’s just really, really, really critical to act because every two months the state will kill someone else this year. So I think that that’s probably where I found my passion – in the fact that it’s a pressing matter. It’s especially urgent here in Alabama. It’s an issue of life and death. I think one of the parts I enjoy the most is how well connected and organized Alabama death penalty activism is. There are a lot of legal, activist, and religious organizations working in the state that are really dedicated to fighting the death penalty and to fighting Alabama’s long history of racial injustice, specifically when it comes to how the justice system operates and especially how it operates in terms of the death penalty. I really enjoy being a part of it and being able to work with many people who have been doing this work for decades. I mean some of them have spent over half a century working on Alabama death penalty reform. It’s just great to be there to learn from them. It’s no secret that the death penalty is just absolutely rife with racial injustice issues, especially in Alabama. Over 50 per cent or pretty close to 50 per cent of our death row is made up of Black men, which is just a staggering number given that they make up less than a quarter of the State’s overall population. A lot of these men have stories and histories of small town 20th century Alabama racial politics, filled with inconsistent legal representation and unfair prosecutions that resulted in the death sentences that they are facing today. In a world in which I could wave a magic wand, the Alabama State House would pass a law against it. Realistically, what needs to happen is people need to vote… and people need to vote for people that they believe align with their moral values. In Alabama, it’s increasingly clear that representatives are willing to vote on party lines, to strike down reasonable, fair and legitimate legislation surrounding the death penalty. And so, I think the only way that Alabama can move forward is to make our views known to them, put pressure on them to uphold their responsibility to protect human rights as people in a position of authority. It is about redesigning the society we live in to reflect the values that we want to live by. I hope when I graduate to go to law school and then come back to Alabama, assuming I leave Alabama. I hope to use my legal degree to provide legal representation to clients facing the death penalty and use that knowledge to continue with further policymaking and activism. My personal hopes are that Alabama comes to its senses for sure. It’s difficult to watch the state continue to kill people and to do it so mercilessly and so often. I would tell people to write a letter to someone on death row. Write a letter to our government. I’ve written countless letters at this point, and I think a lot of people in this state have. If you really want to spend your time wisely and do something that will make a difference for somebody, write a letter to someone on death row. Every year for Rocky Myers’ birthday, we do birthday cards as solidarity actions We do Christmas cards for him and that’s all run through Amnesty’s Rocky Myers page. It makes such an incredible difference in their lives when they receive a birthday card or a Christmas card from someone that they’ve never met, just wishing them well and hoping things work out for the best. So if I could encourage people to do one thing, it would probably be that. You can fight to protect human rights, just like TJ Riggs.

0,Three activists on why they refuse to be silent in older age,AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2024/05/three-activists-on-why-they-refuse-to-be-silent-in-older-age/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? This week, as the United Nations moves towards an international convention on the rights of older persons, Amnesty International is launching a new campaign: Age Loud! We demand a world where human rights last a lifetime, and where older voices are no longer ignored. Older people around the world are actively campaigning to defend our human rights, whether they’re fighting climate change, standing up for LGBT+ rights, or speaking out against enforced disappearances. They are refusing to back down or be silent. We asked three older activists to reflect on their experiences, the changes they are campaigning for, and how being an older person gives them unique perspective and motivation. Cecile is a lifelong activist working on anti-racism and climate change. After a homelessness crisis amongst migrants in Belgium in 2015, my husband and I hosted two people from Ethiopia who the authorities had left to sleep in a city park. They told us that in Ethiopia they were small-scale farmers and grew food for their families. However, it was raining less frequently, and growing food was becoming more difficult. That was when I realized that climate change was one of the most important issues in the world today, and that it would have far-reaching consequences. Soon after that I participated in a citizens assembly discussing how best to address climate change and reduce carbon emissions. We learned how to mobilize people and change behaviours. I joined an advocacy collective, Grandparents for the Climate, and started working actively on the issue. We quickly realized that banks and other financial institutions, through their investments, were responsible for a large share of our carbon footprint and often directly funded projects that were “carbon bombs”. We asked ourselves how, as older people, we could encourage banks to divest from fossil fuels and started spreading the word about how we can all make informed choices that support green financial investments. I have been amazed at what I have learned during my journey as an activist. Banks and their investments have far-reaching impacts on the climate crisis. We now work closely with youth organizations to strengthen our impact and build our influence. We have a responsibility to future generations to address this challenge today. It already has wide-ranging impacts on people of all ages. I remember when I was a child that we would joke that an older person was someone who “wouldn’t make it through the winter”, but today due to rising temperatures we sadly have to ask whether some older people can “make it through the summer”. I recently saw how a group of older women won a landmark court case that the Swiss government’s weak climate change policy had violated their rights. This will help advance the cause greatly, for people of all ages. I feel that my years of experience help me see the best path forward to achieving the impact we want. As older people, we can draw attention to these issues – younger people and the media are often interested in what we have to say on the issue. I’m older now, but I still feel very active, creative and motivated – we all sometimes get tired, but there is no question that we must take action now. Amina is an activist on behalf of victims of the armed conflict in north-east Nigeria and their families, including those who have been unlawfully killed or detained. I became an activist nine years ago when Boko Haram forced us to leave our homes, and we found ourselves living in camps controlled by the Nigerian government. The military made baseless accusations that our sons were associated with Boko Haram. Our sons were blindfolded and arrested and held in dehumanizing conditions. I had no choice but to start campaigning for their release. As mothers, we came together and started a movement to seek justice. We are demanding that all those detained unlawfully be released immediately and that the government investigate the gross violations we have experienced. Some of our sons have been in detention for more than 10 years. We have had enough, we want justice. As older people, we are so often abandoned and ignored by our governments because of our age. We are sidelined from consultations or engagements about our community, we are dismissed and told that we are too old. But I will not relent because of my age. Sometimes as an older person I can have more of an impact because, for some in society, my words carry more weight. In general, I would say my age is a positive thing when it comes to my activism. I tell other older people that they should continue with their activism and bear with the challenges, and that our activism can also inspire younger people. I know it is not easy, but these causes are important. Age should not and will not deter us from making our society free from injustice. Juan is an activist on social issues and LGBTQ+ liberation. In the 1960s, I was part of Mexican student movements. Then Stonewall happened: I had a boyfriend at the time who lived in New York, and he told me that I had to come and see it for myself. I witnessed the first LGBTQ+ rebellion: the first time gay men, trans people, lesbians were standing up and confronting the police. Coming back to Mexico, we started the Frente de Liberación Homosexual (Gay Liberation Front). I had learned a lot about how to make protests visible and how to make our voices heard. Finally, there was a space where we could be active, where we could do something. When I started my activism, we didn’t use the term “human rights” – but that’s what it has always been about. We held large demonstrations against political repression, for the abolition of the death penalty, and to fight restrictions on social protest. Persecution by the government was very real and close to us at the time – gay men and trans women were persecuted, raided by the police, extorted and beaten up. Whenever we were out in the street, we felt that something bad could happen. We were struggling for our lives, for our security, for our right to be in the street without being beaten up, robbed or killed. Older gay men in Mexico sometimes struggle to come together or to have groups and spaces they can engage with. This can be for a number of reasons, including for some, having not come out to their family members. My whole life, I have never stopped being an activist. The AIDS epidemic collapsed the first phase of gay liberation. So many activists died and [as I grew older], I recognised the need to transmit my experience, knowledge and values [to the younger generation]. Since 1981 I’ve been part of Collective Sol, where we work to build and strengthen the capacity of small, grassroots organizations that are working on the most pressing LGBTQ+ issues they see today. We all have human rights, but we are often not aware of them. In our community, we often don’t have a full understanding of what citizenship means and the rights we hold. My whole life as an activist I have learned that by mobilizing people to demand their rights, step by step, little by little, we can see real change. My life as an activist means I can look back and say I have witnessed three great moments in LGBTQ+ liberation. The first was when we formed political organizations, coming out of the shadows and breaking the silence. The second was the HIV/AIDS epidemic, the way it created a connection between LGBTQ+ liberation and people living with HIV, irrespective of whether they were LGBTQ+. This connection was powerful and drove the movement forward. And in just the last few weeks, we saw what I consider the third great moment – the passing of national legislation to ban conversion therapy. This was the result of a seven-year campaign. It will have a great impact on social perceptions of sexuality and gender identity. The trans movement is so powerful and visible right now, campaigning on issues that are very close to their day-to-day lives as they face such exclusion. I really admire all the organizations taking forward the fight. As an older activist, I feel privileged to see how these younger generations are responding to new challenges – it’s something we never dreamed of in our movement when we were young.

0,Nikole: “I come from the world of technology where there are very few women”,AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2024/05/i-come-from-the-world-of-technology-where-there-are-very-few-women/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? Nikole Yanez is a computer scientist by training, and a human rights defender from Honduras. She is passionate about feminism, the impact of the internet and protecting activists. She was first drawn to human rights through her work as a reporter with a local community radio station. After surviving the coup d’état in Honduras in 2009, Nikole broadened her approach to focus her activism on technology. When she applied for the Digital Forensics Fellowship with the Amnesty Tech Security Lab in 2022, she was looking to learn more about cybersecurity and apply what she learnt with the organizations and collectives she works with regularly.   She highlighted her commitment to fostering a network of tech-savvy communities across Latin America in an interview with Elina Castillo, Amnesty Tech’s Advocacy and Policy Advisor. I grew up in Honduras, where I lived through the coup d’état, which took place in 2009. It was a difficult time where rights were non-existent, and people were constantly afraid. I thought it was something you only read about in history books, but it was happening in front of my eyes. I felt myself just trying to survive, but as time went by it made me stronger and want to fight for justice. Despite the difficulties, people in my community remained hopeful and we created a community radio station, which broadcast stories about everyday people and their lives with the aim of informing people about their human rights. I was a reporter, developing stories about individual people and their fight for their rights. From there, I found a passion for working with technology and it inspired me to train to become a computer scientist. I am always looking for ways to connect technology with activism, and specifically to support women and Indigenous people in their struggles. As much as technology presents risks for human rights defenders, it also offers opportunities for us to better protect ourselves and strengthen our movements. Technology can bring more visibility to our movements, and it can empower our work by allowing us to connect with other people and learn new strategies. In my work, my perspective as a feminist helps me centre the experiences and needs of marginalised people for trainings and outreach. It is important for me to publicly identify as an Afrofeminist in a society where there is impunity for gendered and racist violence that occurs every day. In Honduras we need to put our energy into supporting these communities whose rights are most violated, and whose stories are invisible. For example, in 2006, I was working with a Union to install the Ubuntu operating system (an open-source operating system) on their computers. We realized that the unionists didn’t know how to use a computer, so we created a space for digital literacy and learning about how to use a computer at the same time. This became not just a teaching exercise, but an exercise for me to figure out how to connect these tools to what people are interested in. Something clicked for me in this moment, and this experience helped solidify my approach to working on technology and human rights. There are not many women working in technology and human rights. I don’t want to be one of the only women, so my goal is to see more women colleagues working on technical issues. I want to make it possible for women to work in this field. I also want to motivate more women to create change within the intersection of technology and human rights. Using a feminist perspective and approach, we ask big questions about how we are doing the work, what our approach needs to be, and who we need to work with.    For me, building a feminist internet means building an internet for everyone. This means creating a space where we do not reproduce sexist violence, where we find a community that responds to the people, to the groups, and to the organizations that fight for human rights. This includes involving women and marginalised people in building the infrastructure, in the configuration of servers, and in the development of protocols for how we use all these tools. In Honduras, there aren’t many people trained in digital forensics analysis, yet there are organizations that are always seeking me out to help check their phones. The fellowship helped me learn about forensic analysis on phones and computers and tied the learning to what I’m actually doing in my area with different organizations and women’s rights defenders. The fellowship was practical and rooted in the experience of civil society organizations. Well first, it’s incredibly relevant for women rights defenders. Everyone wants to know if their phone has been hacked. That’s the first thing they ask:, “Can you actually know whether your phone has been hacked?” and “How do I know? Can you do it for me? How?” Those are the things that come up in my trainings and conversations. I like to help people to think about protection as a process, something ongoing, because we use technology all day long. There are organizations and people that take years to understand that. So, it’s not something that can be achieved in a single conversation. Sometimes a lot of things need to happen, including bad things, before people really take this topic seriously. More than anything else, I talk about protection. We talk about digital security, and how to configure your phone. Very simple, basic things, that help people to feel more protected. I try to use very basic tools when I’m doing digital security support, to say you can do this on whatever device you’re on, this is a prevention tool. It’s not just applying technical knowledge, it’s also a process of explaining, training, showing how this work is not just for hackers or people who know a lot about computers. One of the challenges is to spread awareness about cybersecurity among Indigenous and grassroots organizations, which aren’t hyper-connected and don’t think that digital forensics work is relevant to them. Sometimes what we do is completely disconnected from their lives, and they ask us: “But what are you doing?” So, our job is to understand their questions and where they are coming from and ground our knowledge-sharing in what people are actually doing. If you are a human rights defender, I would recommend that you share your knowledge with your collective. You can teach them the importance of knowing about them, practicing them, as well as encouraging training to prevent digital attacks, because, in the end, forensic analysis is a reaction to something that has happened. We can take a lot of preventive measures to ensure the smallest possible impact. That’s the best way to start. And it’s crucial to stay informed, to keep reading, to stay up to date with the news and build community. If there are girls or gender non-conforming people reading this who are interested in technical issues, it doesn’t matter if you don’t have a degree or a formal education, as long as you like it. Most hackers I’ve met become hackers because they dive into a subject, they like it and they’re passionate about it. And if you’re passionate about these subjects, then I’d invite you to take the plunge, jump in, seize the opportunity and enjoy yourselves. We need more people working on these issues.

0,Stefan Simanowitz: There will only ever be one Mandela but there are many others around the world following in his footsteps,AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2024/05/there-will-only-ever-be-one-mandela-but-there-are-many-others-around-the-world-following-in-his-footsteps/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? Today marks 30 years since Nelson Mandela became President of South Africa. For Amnesty International’s Europe Media Manager, Stefan Simanowitz, it was an important moment marking the start of his journey as a young activist and journalist. Here, he recalls why his trip to South Africa to work for the African National Congress was just the start of his fight for human rights. Exactly thirty years ago, just after Nelson Mandela had taken the oath of office as South Africa’s first fully representative democratically elected President, came a moment that still gives me goosebumps. There was a deafening roar as squadron of fighter jets flew low over the assembled crowd of which I was part. Instinctively, we flinched. But then four gigantic Oryx helicopters passed low above our heads each towing beneath it a giant flag of the new South Africa and it dawned on us. The military — and the state to which the military belonged — were no longer enemies of the people: they now belonged to the people. If Mandela’s inauguration was a highwater mark of human development, the current state of world affairs feels like a low point in recent history.  After graduating, I had travelled to South Africa to work for the African National Congress (ANC) as it transitioned from liberation movement to political party and ultimately, to government. I’d long been active in the Anti-Apartheid Movement in Britain and was filled with a youthful idealism which – despite having taken a battering – has never left me. Indeed, the power of that inauguration day and the struggle that had led up to it, remain an indelible source of inspiration for me as an activist. When Nelson Mandela was released from jail in 1992, South African poet Breyten Breytenbach wrote: “Perhaps there is now a little more sense to our dark passage on Earth,” and as Mandela was sworn in, watched by a live television audience of more than a billion, these words had never rung so true. Sadly, in the three decades that have passed since, they have not come close to ringing so true again.  Not only has that moment of high-octane global optimism not been matched, but with the world mired in seemingly intractable conflicts and almost seven months into the Gaza war, that day feels like a very distant place.  Indeed, if Mandela’s inauguration was a highwater mark of human development, the current state of world affairs feels like a low point in recent history. Yet despite the current clouds of despondency, there are lessons to be learned and hope to be gleaned from that day in South Africa and the movement that made it possible. To understand how that day came about, it is vital to recognise the fortuitous confluence of historical and political factors at work. The fall of the Berlin Wall less than five years before had shifted the Cold War’s tectonic plates undermining support among some Western governments for the system of apartheid as a bulwark to the supposed threat of Communism. The impact of boycotts was being keenly felt and the clamour of international approbation was growing ever louder. Added to this, the grassroots anti-apartheid struggle was reaching its height with a politically educated population unified around a single clear goal steered by leaders of remarkable integrity, principle and moral stature.  There are lessons to be learned and hope to be gleaned from that day in South Africa and the movement that made it possible. Simplistic depictions of the ‘miracle birth’ of the so-called rainbow nation, mask the fact that that day in 1994 was the culmination of a long and painful gestation. The ANC had been formed 82 years earlier and the liberation movement had seen decades of campaigning, struggle and sacrifice.   Indeed, it is easy to forget just how close the country came to civil war even in those tense months, weeks and days before the elections. As someone who was working for the ANC during that time, I can attest that there were many times — right up until election day itself — that, in Mandela’s words, it seemed impossible until it was done. At midnight on election eve, I watched as the new flag was raised above parliament in Cape Town. A few days later, as the results were announced in Cape Town’s Grand Parade, a wave of emotion swept the crowd. A week after the results, I joined a bunch of ANC staff as we piled into a battered Toyota and made the journey to Pretoria to witness history. For me, Nelson Mandela, had been part of my consciousness for almost as long as I could remember and South Africa’s freedom struggle was my formative political experience. As a child visiting South Africa, I would lie on my fold-out bed on the balcony of my grandparents’ flat looking out across the dark ocean at the dimly burning lights of Robben Island and think of him. At school, I had done projects on apartheid and for so many years I had marched and protested and campaigned. In 1990, when news broke that Mandela would be released, I went straight to Trafalgar Square in London to celebrate, and the following day I stayed glued to the TV screen for the first glimpse of him.  Those who bore witness to the South African liberation movement do not just believe that change is possible. They know it can happen. Watching as Mandela was sworn in, I was convinced that politics could change the world. But, as the promise of genuine transformative change as set out in the ANC’s Freedom Charter drained away, I turned my energies to grassroots campaigning and then to journalism. Reporting from Tahrir Square in Cairo during the Arab Spring or the Zuccotti Park in New York during the Occupy Movement, I saw occasional flashes of the energy that I’d experienced in South Africa but, as the limits of journalism became increasingly apparent, I returned to campaigning. Some may ask “Where are today’s Mandelas?”, and although we may never see his like again, there are many around the world following in his footsteps. I have been privileged to encounter and even work with many of them during my decade working for Amnesty International. Their stories and struggles may not make the headlines, but each day courageous activists and human rights defenders, poets and politicians, musicians and journalists stand up against injustice. And each year, we celebrate their victories. What has happened in South Africa over the last three decades – the false steps and failures – does not tarnish the brightness of that day which shone with possibility in newly post-Cold War world. Whilst these may be dark times, we should take strength from that day thirty years ago. Change does not come easily and it does not come quickly. But nonetheless, those who bore witness to the remarkable power of the South African liberation movement do not just believe that change is possible. They know it can happen.

0,Understanding Human Rights In Policing: An Online Course For Human Rights Activists and Practitioner,AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2024/05/understanding-human-rights-in-policing-an-online-course-for-human-rights-activists-and-practitioners/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? Have you ever wondered about the critical role of police during protests? Are you curious about the rules governing the use of force and firearms by police officials? Interested in understanding under what circumstances police may carry out an arrest? Would you like to understand the impact of racial and other forms of discrimination on policing?   We are thrilled to announce that from 8 May, you can enrol in a course on the Amnesty Human Rights Academy that addresses exactly these topics: Police and Human Rights.   From the killing of George Floyd in the United States, the extrajudicial executions of Afro-Brazilians living in Brazil’s favelas, to the repression of protesters in Hong Kong and the unlawful use of force during protests in Thailand, Peru and worldwide, you will look at real-life examples of policing and human rights. Around the world, the misuse of police powers often leads to devastating outcomes. Particularly in the context of protests, there are almost daily reports of restrictions imposed on demonstrations, unlawful use of force, the misuse of less lethal weapons, excessive surveillance, and arbitrary arrests and detention by the police. Police have powers, but they also have the duty to respect and protect human rights. There are strict rules to determine how much force can be used and when.   All too often, police officials who kill or injure people after using force unlawfully are not brought to justice.  That’s why it’s so important to know what the police are and are not allowed to do. The United Nations Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials (BPUFF) is the key international legal instrument that deals with the police’s use of force. According to these principles, police officers may only use lethal force as a last resort when such means are strictly necessary to protect themselves or others from the imminent threat of death or serious injury, and only when other options for de-escalation are insufficient.  This course will allow you to learn about the international and regional frameworks that should govern police actions. It will provide you with knowledge and understanding to advocate for your rights and challenge policies and practices that do not comply with human rights.  People from racialised communities or marginalised groups often face disproportionate identity checks, searches, and unlawful arrests by the police. Discriminated against groups are often overpoliced, with the police excessively enforcing vaguely worded provisions related to the disturbance of public order or deliberately targeting these groups for alleged drug offences and petty crimes.   To demonstrate how deeply ingrained discrimination is in law enforcement and justice systems around the world we have integrated discrimination across the course by including a lesson specifically on discrimination in each module The final module looks at racism and other forms of discrimination in more detail, highlighting how systemic factors contribute to discriminatory practices within policing. Using an intersectional lens, you will get a basic understanding of different forms of discrimination in policing such as disproportionate arrests, torture, unlawful use of force during protests and at the border, racial profiling, and the discriminatory use of new technologies.    No one is above the law –including those charged with upholding it. International human rights law requires all governments to ensure an effective and impartial investigation of all complaints against police officials, and to impose disciplinary or criminal sanctions where appropriate.  But Amnesty has documented in many countries how police officers who unlawfully kill or injure people frequently get away with it. In some cases, police and security forces threaten the judiciary, witnesses or survivors, pressuring them to drop charges. In other cases, laws are passed to give police immunity or otherwise obstruct justice, even when they act against the law. Sometimes a country’s president or head of the police actually orders police forces to kill anyone they believe to be a criminal suspect. When people in positions of power sanction murder and promise immunity, accountability of the police is fundamentally undermined.  In this course you will learn how crucial accountability of the police is to prevent human rights violations. If police officers commit crimes without punishment or consequences, they are more likely to break the law, rules and regulations again, contributing to a climate of impunity. Effective accountability is essential to ensure lawful and human rights-compliant policing.  You can learn more about Amnesty’s new free course on Police and Human Rights, developed by experts in the field at Amnesty International and accessibly designed for anyone who is interested in police and human rights issues.  There are nine self-learning modules, which you can follow at your own pace. Each will take approximately an hour to complete. You can take a single module or complete the entire course based on your interests. Through quizzes, Amnesty’s research, videos, and self-directed learning materials, you will learn about a wide range of topics related to human rights-compliant policing. Each module offers additional materials for those interested in deeper learning.   Using Amnesty’s research, you will study critical issues like the policing of protests, arrest and detention, and the obligation to facilitate protests. You will learn about the various lethal and less lethal weapons and the rules around the lawful use of these weapons and how to hold police accountable for human rights violations.   Whether you’re a human rights activist, researcher, academic, work in the judiciary sector or are simply curious about these critical topics, these modules will equip you with essential knowledge and insights. Upon completion of the whole course, participants are granted a certificate.  The course is now available for free in English on Amnesty’s Human Rights Academy.   We hope you will enjoy your learning experience and look forward to hearing your feedback!  Every year, our global community comes together to fight injustice and support people whose human rights are under threat.

0,Amnesty researchers share their biggest human rights concerns in 2023-24,AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2024/04/amnesty-researchers-share-their-biggest-human-rights-concerns-in-2023-24/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? Amnesty International’s The State of the World’s Human Rights report delivers an assessment of human rights in 155 countries. 2023 saw escalating conflicts and the near breakdown of international law.  Powerful governments cast humanity into an era devoid of effective international rule of law, with civilians in conflicts paying the highest price, and rapid changes in artificial intelligence created fertile ground for discrimination, racism, and division.  Meet some of the researchers working on the front lines of these pressing human rights issues. Researcher on Conflict in Somalia and Sudan, East and Southern Africa Regional Office Abdullahi Hassan is a Kenyan lawyer and a human rights advocate. He has worked with Amnesty International since 2018 where he has carried out complex research into various human rights topics including war crimes in Sudan and Somalia, violations of freedom of expression as well as the impact of Covid-19 on Somalia’s healthcare system. There were many situations that were challenging, but the most striking one for me was the eruption of the large-scale conflict in Sudan. This conflict has had a devastating impact on civilians: 12,000 people were killed in 2023 and more than 8 million displaced making Sudan the largest internal displacement crisis in the world. As of March 2024, more than 2.9 million children in Sudan are acutely malnourished and 729,000 children under five are suffering from severe acute malnutrition. The whole country is now on the brink of collapse. I feel completely heartbroken by the horrific events unfolding in Sudan. Hundreds of Sudanese I interviewed told me devastating stories on how their dreams were shattered. It has been honestly exhausting to track all the violations and abuses that occurred in Sudan in 2023. The people of Sudan deserve better. My work mostly involves investigating conflict-related and other human rights violations and abuses in Sudan and Somalia. I monitor, document and report on these abuses for Amnesty International. I also advocate with various actors including governments, regional and international bodies such as the UN and the African Union. They were many. One moment that stuck with me is interviewing a woman from West Darfur in one of the refugee camps in eastern Chad. She told me that her husband and her four brothers-in-law were all shot and killed while she watched. She had a young baby in her lap. She was visibly weak and traumatized and kept sobbing throughout. She said her life was torn apart. There are many human rights challenges in our region. These include suppression of civic space, inequalities, devastating impact of climate change and conflict-related human rights violations. Six countries in our region have either active or long running conflicts leading to massive civilian suffering and displacement crises. Amnesty International is an organization that takes injustice personally. Hundreds of its employees including myself work hard day and night to document and expose violations in very difficult circumstances. This evidence is then used to advocate for victims of abuses, influence policy makers, and encourage bad actors to change their ways. In a world where we are increasingly witnessing unimaginable horrors resulting from man-made disasters with no accountability, it is more important than ever to support Amnesty International’s work. As an optimistic human rights advocate, I hope to see a world that is free from human rights violations. In places where there are ongoing conflicts, I hope to see justice for victims and survivors of violations and abuses and perpetrators held accountable. Researcher, Middle East and North Africa Regional Office Budour Hassan is Amnesty International’s researcher on Israel and the Occupied Palestinian territories. Before joining Amnesty International, she worked as a legal researcher and advocacy officer at the Jerusalem Legal Aid Centre.  It was a year of earthquakes in the region, starting in Syria and Turkey and later in Libya. But perhaps the biggest earthquake of all is what we have been witnessing in Gaza. All over the Middle East and North Africa region, there have been crackdowns against freedom of expression, association and assembly. There have been hunger strikes by detainees. There has been a lot of torture. Finding even glimmers of positivity is very difficult. It’s been mostly challenging, although as human rights defenders and as researchers, we try to find hope through whatever positivity our work can bring. At least the awareness, the fact that some of our evidence can be used to push for, say, an arms embargo and for accountability and justice is what gives worth to our work. The most difficult part for me as a researcher has been to document the war crimes and atrocity crimes committed in Gaza. Speaking with people on the ground documenting Israeli air strikes and their aftermath, talking with victims and survivors. As researchers, we interview witnesses, survivors and victims. And then we check these testimonies against the visual evidence and other types of evidence we have. We analyse satellite imagery of attacks, we review official accounts and official claims in full, from all sides, with the hope of concluding whether a violation of international law was committed. We also work on documentation of forcible transfers (the forced relocation of civilian populations). This relies on interviewing victims for testimonies and collecting what the alleged perpetrators say: working on the ground and visiting displaced communities and communities at risk. I was on the phone with a father in Gaza who lost his entire family, and he was reciting the names of his children who were killed. He was so calm, so composed. For me, it was striking to hear the lilt and the tone of his voice. And suddenly he heard a voice calling him and he apologized and said, “I’m sorry, I need to go. Because they told me that they found my little daughter’s stole.” This piece of clothing is the only thing that was left of her after her entire body was destroyed and torn apart by a bomb. And to think that we as researchers have the responsibility to share the testimony of this father, of this grieving father. And that this father, despite everything, despite his grief, is taking the time to talk to us. Despite probably having almost no battery, despite having lost everything, it puts a huge responsibility on us to be true to these stories, to fight as hard as we can, to bring justice and accountability for them. First and foremost, there are the issues of violations of international humanitarian law, unlawful killings, indiscriminate air strikes or indiscriminate attacks, arbitrary detention, torture and other ill treatment of detainees. Palestinians in Gaza are facing the risk of genocide. All over the region there is the issue of systematic violations of freedom of expression, association and assembly, failure to respect people’s basic rights, including the right to due process and a fair trial. These, unfortunately, have been issues that have plagued all countries in the region. The reason why we document human rights violations is to use the documentation as evidence to achieve justice: to be used in a court of law, to put pressure on authorities to change their behaviour, to mobilize protesters, to mobilize the Amnesty International movement. When we see that courts are citing Amnesty International in decisions, for example to halt arms sales, it just shows the importance of this work. Personally, the biggest hope is to one day live in a region where there are no people who are arbitrarily detained or arrested over the free and peaceful expression of their opinions. To have prisons empty of torture. To have prisons empty of people detained for politically motivated reasons, or for their opinions. And of course, as we said so many times, justice for the victims. A victim-oriented approach where accountability is brought, where perpetrators are held accountable in fair trials. This is the hope that fuels our work. Advocacy Advisor on Artificial Intelligence Regulation, Amnesty Tech Mher Hakobyan is an Advocacy Advisor on AI regulation within the Algorithmic Accountability Lab (AAL) of the Amnesty Tech Programme. He joined Amnesty International around one and a half years ago to advocate on the EU’s landmark Artificial Intelligence Regulation (AI Act). This is part of a civil society effort to ensure a human-rights-based AI regulation that would set a high bar for regulatory efforts around the world. After years of negotiations between the European Union (EU) and EU member states, the European Parliament voted to adopt the EU’s artificial intelligence regulation, the so-called EU Act. The Act is considered the world’s first comprehensive Artificial Intelligence legislation and will address development and deployment of technologies in a broad spectrum of domains, from education to housing, policing and migration control, among many others. It will impact a lot of rights that are essential for people, including the rights of migrants, refugees and asylum seekers, and the right to non-discrimination, to privacy, to peaceful protest, to social protection, among many other rights. The past three years of working on the EU Act has been somewhat of a rollercoaster of emotions. It started with frustrations regarding the insufficient human rights protections in the first draft of the law. Then we had a spark of hope in the European Parliament’s more ambitious position. But it ended in great disappointment due to the very watered down, weak text in terms of human rights protections in the final Act text that was agreed between the member states and the EU. This was largely because of EU member states’ pressure to trade crucial protections for people in favour of allowing disproportionate discretion to tech companies and almost unchecked power for law enforcement and other state agencies. So, it’s been quite a challenging year, but it’s also been greatly inspiring to work among the brilliant civil society coalition and with many dedicated people who are fighting for a better future in Europe and beyond. As an Advocacy Advisor at Amnesty International, my role has been to communicate our policy positions to negotiators during this process and essentially convince them that human rights should be the absolute priority in the text of the law. I think one of my most striking but also worrying memories from the past years has been seeing some representatives of member states argue that the Act would constrain the ability of law enforcement agencies to fight crime. According to them, criminal actors using new technologies are not constrained by the text of the law. Whereas the crucial human rights safeguards in the artificial intelligence law would, in their view, constrain law enforcement ability. This kind of dangerous thinking led to watering down the essential protections for human rights and giving unchecked power to law enforcement, national security and migration authorities in the Act. I think the challenge of the coming years will be to hold authorities and private companies to account while they continue to use artificial intelligence technologies, largely without public transparency and scrutiny. Unfortunately, we know that the risks to human rights are higher than ever for migrants, refugees, asylum seekers, racialized people and other marginalized people, because artificial intelligence can exacerbate discrimination, exclusion and abuse at scale and of course, create new risks. Lack of transparency will make it very hard, if not impossible, to know where harms occur and to hold perpetrators accountable. My hope for the coming years will be that people support us in holding companies and public authorities to account. And as for countries outside of the EU, I hope they will not repeat the mistakes of the EU, as they legislate on artificial intelligence. I hope they put people and our rights and interests at the forefront and do not succumb to the pressure of corporate lobbying and their own desire for power.

Until the fighting erupted in Khartoum in April 2023, Elaf Ahmed worked as a personal assistant to the Ambassador of Switzerland to Sudan and Eritrea. But when the fighting between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which began in Khartoum, spread to Darfur, North Kordofan and later to the Gezira state and with-it large-scale destruction, Elaf and her family fled to Kenya. She now makes Sudanese snacks from her kitchen, struggling to make ends meet. “On the day the conflict began in Khartoum, 15 April 2023, I was at home. It was a weekend, and I had an appointment with a doctor downtown. When I left the apartment, I heard the shooting. I stopped everything, and I contacted my colleagues in other embassies and international organizations. They told me it’s an unsafe situation, it’s better to stay at home. I was living in Arkawit, near the airport. The situation in that area was very bad. We lost electricity, water, and I remember we brought all the mattresses into the sitting room, to avoid broken glass hitting my children. It was really dangerous. We stayed there for about five days, living like that. We were fasting as it was Ramadan. We finally decided to leave. Every day, the situation was getting worse. My daughter was crying all the time. She would cry silently, maybe out of fear and trauma. She would cry at the sound of airplanes and at the sound of shooting. She was four years old and the little one was six months old. We collected small things, including their medicines, as they have asthma. I collected a few clothes for me and my husband. For the kids, I collected many pieces for them because I could not guarantee where I would wash them. We went to my husband’s home in Jazira state. We stayed there from April to July. We left my parents and brothers behind in Khartoum, in an area called Al Taif. It was in a bad situation because the area was under the control of the RSF.  In July, we decided to leave Sudan because the situation was getting worse. We planned to go to Egypt but the little one doesn’t have a passport, so, I added her to my passport. Two days after, the government of Egypt stopped accepting anyone without a passport, so we had to cancel. We started our search again, and we found Ethiopia, Eritrea and Kenya were options. We decided to come to Kenya. We thought as we both had academic backgrounds and diplomatic professional experience, it would open good opportunities to find work, because we had lost everything! When we arrived at Nairobi’s airport, they would not let us in as the little one did not have a passport. More than 12 hours later we were allowed in, after sleeping on an airport bench. We were finally in Nairobi. My husband’s friend had arrived in the city a month before us and found us accommodation. My daughter has started school here in Nairobi. At first, she struggled with the new environment but now she loves it here and can even speak Swahili! However, life is not easy. I wish I could back home, I miss my family, everything was stable. I had a good job and salary, but then we lost everything, including our apartment, furniture, our properties and our cars. We didn’t see this coming. The war just started, and everyone was left in shock. I miss everything about home. I am now jobless; I have nothing to do. Since I’ve been in Nairobi, I have started a brand called Orjuwan, from my kitchen, cooking Sudanese pastries. I started with two items, Falafel dough and Basbousa and I have since added Kofta and pastry with cheese and beef to the menu. I got this idea because when we arrived, we missed Falafel and our Sudanese food. I got the idea as I thought many Sudanese must be fleeing to Nairobi and we must all miss the same things.   I announced my idea through Sudanese WhatsApp groups. So far, business is doing well, but it depends on the financial situation of the Sudanese here. We are still hopeful for job opportunities. Every night my husband and I stay up to look for jobs on our laptops but there’s nothing. We don’t know how to find work, how can we start the work permit procedures, and from where can we pay for the work permit fees? As we are out of money.  How can we find jobs? Even if we wanted to leave Kenya, we can’t as we don’t have the money to travel, my little daughter doesn’t have a passport and my older daughter’s passport has expired. Everyone is facing obstacles. Some have lost family members, but I am thankful we are fine. I just want to provide a safe home for my daughters. As for Sudan, I just want peace. What would I want to see for Sudan? Peace. I hope action can be taken against the warring factions. This conflict won’t be solved easily, and it’s the civilians that are losing out. I hope we can have peace as soon as possible.

Arif Elsawi, the founder of Sudan Facts Center for Journalism, settled in Nairobi long before the Sudan current fighting between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), began.  Now living in Kenya, he is one of the faces behind Atar, a weekly publication that sheds light on the plight of Sudanese civilians caught in the fighting. “On 15th April, the day fighting erupted in Khartoum, I was in Nairobi. I was supposed to travel to Khartoum, Sudan, on a Tuesday, but the war started on Saturday morning. Most of the Sudanese I know were expecting something to happen. There were a lot of indicators of war, but nobody thought that it would happen on such a large scale. Like others, I thought the fighting would last around two months, but it’s been going on for a year now. It’s become more complicated, other parties are getting involved and it’s no longer about the two parties, the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), who were fighting in the beginning. It will go on for a lot longer unless the international and regional initiatives, such as the African Union, the IGAD (Intergovernmental Authority on Development), and Sudan’s neighboring countries, get involved. I have been a journalist for almost 20 years now covering stories in Sudan and East Africa. I decided to come to Nairobi in 2009, to see what I could do for my career. I initially founded the Facts Center for Journalism, where I worked and trained young professional journalists or young Sudanese people who wanted to build a career in journalism. The aim was to train them for six months, after which they would graduate. After the war broke out, we decided to form Atar, alongside 12 of our trainees, with the aim of sharing stories from Sudan. The young journalists we work with are the heart of Atar, because most of them are correspondents from different cities and towns in Sudan. Some of them are still living in Sudan, while others are in Ethiopia, Uganda and Egypt. Yet they are still writing and sending us stories on Sudan. Now we have a network of over 20 journalists around Sudan, from different cities and different regions. Getting news from Sudan is challenging, especially during the communications shut down, but we are working around it, by using  Starlink, which is a satellite internet service. Other journalists travel miles just to send us stories. There is such buzz from these young journalists – they’re excited to share these stories from within Sudan and it brings extra meaning to the local stories. Practicing journalism in a time of conflict is not hopeless. Sometimes it will give you a positive feeling; sometimes it’s negative, depending on the stories. After a day of working on these stories, we can feel really down about the situation in Sudan. Other times, we feel hopeful for our communities, having read how people are trying to figure out ways to live, survive, get food and travel from A to B. People are being so creative and innovative, despite living under very tough conditions. You can’t even imagine someone living in that situation. There is no electricity and there’s been no clean water for close to four months. But we’re also witnessing how people are using their knowledge to figure out a way to survive these  tough conditions. Journalists are having a difficult time. We are facing threats from both sides – in areas controlled by RSF and areas controlled by SAF. It’s not easy to report independently and clearly We are always accused of taking sides, of being biased, but we are not the only country in the world to witness a war. Yes, we are putting our lives at risk, trying to get the stories out, but we’re also utilizing the knowledge of our colleagues from around the world, watching how they use technology, or other methods to get the stories out. For example, we ran a survey in 2017 to find out how the Sudanese communicate. We discovered  the Sudanese use social media, such as WhatsApp, as a main source for news and for stories. From those living in Sudan to the Sudanese diaspora, we wanted Atar to appeal to all and be easy to share. Considering how weak our network and internet can be, we don’t want them to have to search for us. We want to make it easy for everyone to read our stories and share them. We started with an Arabic publication, and in March we published in English for the first time. We’re also building a website! I miss everything about Sudan. But I’m trying to be realistic every day. I know some things are gone. I can’t even imagine that they will be back. But it’s also an opportunity for us. The war is the hardest thing we will experience, but it’s an opportunity to learn where we can go. Through our journalism, we want to give Sudanese the information that they need to make better decisions and build a better life.

Payu Boonsophon, a 29-year-old environmental activist, was raised by his grandfather, a retired police officer and his grandmother in Chaiyaphum, Thailand. With a passion for people power, Payu believes protests are pivotal to ensuring change is possible. However, two years ago, while attending a protest for environmental justice and human rights outside the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit in Bangkok, Payu was shot in his right eye by a police officer who was firing rubber bullets at the crowd. One of the rubber bullets penetrated Payu’s eyeball, blinding him. Here, Payu shares how he’s rebuilt his life and why it won’t stop him from protesting. In 2022, I attended the Ratsadon Stop APEC 2022 protest (meaning people against APEC). APEC had approved the military-dominated government’s green-washing Bio-Circular-Green Economy (BCG) Policy. It meant the war on Thailand’s natural resources would intensify and we wanted to show them the human faces of those who would suffer from this policy. Little did I know my life was about to change forever. The protest was nothing out of the ordinary. We usually face obstructions by authorities, however, as I work for an NGO, my team and I always assess risks and coordinate with police to make it as safe as possible. On this occasion, my focus was on security and safety and whether we would be able to reach the venue of the APEC conference. We had no intention of using violence. We were there with other protesters, unarmed. The only weapons we had were our banners and sound system. I remember seeing riot police officers blocking our advances, but there was a Plan B.  If they didn’t let us proceed, we would negotiate with authorities to let us pass, explaining we were here to advocate on issues. We didn’t want to cause any harm. The police were arguing with people on the frontlines, including me. I was wearing a helmet, when an officer said, “Hey you, the one wearing the helmet. You will get a lesson, definitely. Prepare yourself.” But we were determined to continue with our activities. Suddenly, police started using batons on the protesters. I don’t know if it was a mistake or caused by anger, but a police officer shot a rubber bullet on the ground, to stop people protesting. It bounced off the ground and hit a protester. Something was off. This wasn’t normal practice. We weren’t allowed to pass, so we waited before we continued with our activities. After lunch, we started our cursing ritual [which involved burning dried chilli peppers and salt a stove]. When we finished, we put a charcoal grill used in our ritual on a police car. The fire had been extinguished, yet the police used water cannon anyway. The protesters were upset, and that’s when the police started using batons and rubber bullets. Some police tried to prevent the clashes, but no one listened to them; the crowd control police commanders failed to control the situation. They shot rubber bullets at a car, and I was worried the glass would break – especially as there were protesters in the back of the vehicle. I went to help them, and when I turned back, a rubber bullet hit me in the eye. I went to help my fellow protesters, but when I turned back, a rubber bullet hit me in the eye. At first, I didn’t know what had happened. It was a hot day, but all I could feel was cold blood on my neck. I could hear a buzzing noise and when I went to check, I noticed a lot of blood coming out of my eye. An officer approached me and told me to go to an ambulance. I realised the injury was serious, but inside I felt fine. I was ready to rejoin the protest. I worried fleetingly about whether I would see after this, but as with every protest we had conducted a risk assessment, so I was mentally prepared. I didn’t panic. On the way to hospital, I remember worrying most of all about my family, but then I had to get treatment and I didn’t have any time to think any further.  My grandparents have always been concerned about my activism. As a student, I joined a group to organize activities to support communities affected by coal mines, but they weren’t violent. When my grandparents heard I had been hit in the eye by a rubber bullet, they told me they feared I would die. They said they would donate their eyes to me. They feared my disability would prevent me from working and I would not be accepted in society. However, after I was discharged, I came home and in time, I was able to show them I could live normally and that it hasn’t affected me. During my recovery, they were supportive. They didn’t ask me to stop. They just asked me to take a break and not stop. Since I lost sight in my right eye, I have had to adapt because everything has a different perspective now. While I was recovering, I would miss things I wanted to pick up. I had to proactively learn to use my body again and rebuild confidence. When I had difficulty grasping things, I was worried I wouldn’t be able to drive. I love driving. I’ve always wanted to race cars or own a garage, but when I was shot by the rubber bullet, I thought I was losing my dream. Now I can ride a motorbike and drive a car. It’s still possible to do the things I love and that brings me joy. I would say I am 90 % normal, and it has relieved any worries my family had. I truly believe that protest is the only tool people can use to make the state listen to them. People have been oppressed, natural resources snatched. They have no power, no voice. We have used other channels made available by government to report problems, but they’ve never taken action. Protest is necessary and essential. Protest is necessary and essential. As a country, we still have a long way to go. Under the current situation, it’s not looking good for peaceful protesters [in Thailand] because they are being prosecuted. We need a new constitution to give more power to people and local government needs to be given the power to solve things on their own. As for myself, I am trying to live normally and pursue my dreams. I still work for the E-san Land Reform Network (Kor Por Aor), which advocates for the fundamental rights of landless farmers who are made even more vulnerable by land-grabbing perpetrated by the state. I am grateful for the support other organizations, such as Amnesty International, have shown me. I have received so many letters of support.   Going forward, I want to see positive changes in society and I do think we are one step closer to having democracy. As long as people love and understand each other I believe the world will be a better place. What happened to Payu should not happen to others. People should be able to peacefully protest safely without fear. The Thai government needs to ensure that policing of protests is compatible with international human rights law and standards and to hold accountable law enforcement officials for unlawful use of force and to ensure an effective remedy for all victims. *This story was originally published on Al Jazeera   Every year, our global community comes together to fight injustice and support people whose human rights are under threat.

0,Ten years on: The women of Chibok speak out,AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2024/04/ten-years-on-the-women-of-chibok-speak-out/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? Ten years ago, 276 schoolgirls were abducted from a government secondary school in Chibok, a town in Borno State, Nigeria. Some of the girls escaped captivity on their own, while others were released following intense campaigning efforts from organizations, including Amnesty International. However, 82 remain in captivity, while more than 1,400 children have been abducted in subsequent attacks. Amnesty International spoke with some of the young women who were safely returned and the mothers of those who are still missing.  Glory Mainta was kidnapped 10 years ago. She has now been released, graduated high school and is rebuilding her life. I am one of the abducted Chibok girls. It was painful to be separated from my parents. My captors did a lot of things to me and the other girls. We were beaten, shouted at – there’s nothing that they didn’t do to us. While they didn’t force us to marry them, what they did to us was worse. We were just managing till God saved us. I had to fetch water, sweep the grounds and do a lot of things women are not supposed to do. It made me feel bad. I cannot even describe how happy I felt the day I learnt I was to be released. I felt like I was in heaven. Since my release, I have returned to school. I was scared to go back at first, so I changed schools to stay close to my parents – I don’t want to spend another minute without them. I have now graduated from secondary school. When I was in the hands of Boko Haram, I missed everything. I feel very sad for the girls who are still in captivity. My hope is that they regain freedom like us. We know what it was like in there, so that’s why I want them to be free, so they can be with their parents. Mary Dauda was abducted by Boko Haram. She reveals the reality of what life was like when she was held in captivity. I remember the day I was taken. It was very bad, I was crying – it’s still so painful. The place I was held captive was very bad. It is something we never expected. We suffered there. We were hungry. We kept thinking of our parents at home and wondered whether we would ever be reunited with them. We wondered how we would stay with our captors, as we didn’t know them. We had heard a lot of stories about Boko Haram and now we were in their clutches, we didn’t know how it would end. These thoughts kept running through my mind. When we were held in captivity, our captors told us we had to marry them otherwise they wouldn’t give us food. We had to build rooms for them and sweep them, so they could get married and sleep inside. They said if we married them, that would be our lives; if we didn’t, we would be their slaves. Those that refused to marry them are still held in captivity. I was released in 2016 and I was overjoyed. I felt like I had been reborn. After I was released, I went to school for three years, then I got married. I now live with my husband and my two children. I would like to return to education at some point – I want to ensure my children go to school and become self-reliant. As for the remaining Chibok girls, I hope they will be released. When Rose Musa’s daughter returned home, she didn’t want to eat or speak to others. Now, having returned to school and found her voice again, she is thriving. I experienced double tragedy when my daughter was abducted. During the same month, my town was attacked and my husband was killed. I was around three months pregnant at the time and I was the only one in the house. Thankfully God gave me strength to go on, and it’s because of him that I am still alive. When I heard that my daughter Junmai Miutah had been released, I was so happy and proud. Although hearing what she went through hasn’t been easy. What happened in the bush is not OK and she was badly affected by it. When she came home, she wouldn’t eat. She didn’t want to talk to other children. Thankfully, she is back in school now and doing well. She is living a good life, supporting the rest of my children and helping to solve any problems that arise. She wants to continue with her education.   I won’t forget those that are still held in captivity. We are praying for their safe return. I want the government to work with others to ensure the other girls can return home – I want their parents to experience the same pride I feel when I look at my daughter. Mary Abdullahi’s daughter Bilkis is still missing. Since my daughter was abducted, I haven’t heard anything from her or about her. I don’t know how she’s doing. I haven’t seen her. I feel bad whenever her name is mentioned. I want the government to do something about it. Our girls weren’t taken from home, they were taken from school. It’s the government that must intervene. Some girls have been released, so I hope that if I continue to plead with the government, my daughter will come home too. I would be so happy if I was able to see my daughter again or speak to her – it’s been 10 years now. I really hope that organizations will continue to campaign for the release of the girls still held in captivity. I just want to see my daughter. That’s my hope. Comfort Ishaya’s daughter, Hauwa, was abducted 10 years ago. She is still missing. My daughter, Hauwa, was abducted from Chibok 10 years ago. When it happened, I felt very bad. There was nothing I could do. It felt like the blood stopped flowing through my body. As a mother, it’s not easy giving birth to a child. I breastfed her for nine months. Then, a few days before her final school exams, she was abducted. It felt we no longer had a relationship. When we heard the girls had been released, I hoped my daughter was one of them, but she wasn’t. Every time someone is released, it’s so painful to realize it’s not your daughter. I wonder whether my daughter is still alive. I really hope she is. That’s what I want. When I eat my food, I think about her and wonder whether she has food. I am always thinking about her. I really hope I can see my daughter again, no matter how old she will be. We can’t forget about the girls who are still missing. I am always thinking about them. I am still searching for my daughter. I want the government at all levels to continue to support me. I hope and pray we see them again.

0,Ten years of Russian occupation in Ukraine: Lives disrupted by war,AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2024/04/ten-years-of-russian-occupation-in-ukraine-lives-disrupted-by-war/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? Four members of staff from Amnesty International give their perspective on the impact Russia’s occupation of Ukraine has had on their lives, and how they feel Ukraine has changed since the full-scale invasion. Before the events of spring 2014, Anna lived in Donetsk, having recently graduated, Anna hoped to pursue a career as a language teacher. “We have lots of spring holidays and”, she recalls that times. “We generally spent them with our relatives in Kramatorsk and nearby villages. That year, however, they told us not to come. ‘We can hear sounds of fighting, there are check points everywhere, food supplies are interrupted,’ they told us. At that moment, it seemed unbelievable, as life in Donetsk was going on as usual.” “I haven’t been in Kramatorsk since the full-scale invasion, but I do occasionally come to Kyiv, and every time I admire that it is as beautiful and lively as it used to be and; my loved ones still live there. But you can still see that life if far from normal there: constant air raid alerts, power cuts, scarcity of certain products” “When I left Donetsk, I thought it was only for 3 months, and everything would be over. But it’s been 10 years since I left home in Donetsk and 2 years since I left my home in Kyiv”. Julia, from Luhansk, which is another city in the east of Ukraine that fell victim of Russia’s invasion, was getting her second degree in political science, preparing for her exams in 2014. Just like Anna, she had to leave home in the summer. “I never expected that something like that could happen in our city. [One the Russian forces arrived] the city felt increasingly more dangerous. Tanks, artillery, trucks, and soldiers started to pass through the city. We tried not to leave the apartment without a good reason. I remember we went to the store; we saw tanks passing along the streets with Russian flags on them and Russian military personnel. All in uniform, with weapons.” “We hesitated to leave. But one day we saw that separatists installed a weapon near our building and started shooting. That is when we decided to leave for Popasna. Now, after the full-scale invasion Popasna is under occupation and about 96 percent of the buildings have been destroyed. “Sometimes I come across pictures of the ruined town in social media. I think what changed for me now is that now I really miss the feeling of control and security. Now I know that anything can happen.” Daryna, who is from a small town near Kyiv, was fifteen when the Russian invasion and occupation started. “My school was right near the presidential administration, and we were witnessing all the events of the Maidan revolution right through our windows.” “When the occupation of Crimea started, as well as hostilities in the east, it didn’t affect me much; I didn’t have any relatives or friends there. I didn’t understand what exactly was happening, but I knew that it was something bad.” “In summer 2014, I started noticing some changes in my neighbourhood. There were more cars with Luhansk and Donetsk plates, more new people. It was much later I found out that my town was one of the centres for displaced people to move in.” “I joined Amnesty International in 2019 when I was 21. As a citizen of Ukraine, I feel terribly guilty that I didn’t do enough to support people who lost their homes because of Russia’s invasion back in 2014.” I think now, after I am also displaced, I understand that as Ukrainians we want solidarity from the world and we want people to empathize with us, but I also remember how we ourselves weren’t able to provide necessary support to our compatriots. So, I realize how difficult it can be to understand what is really happening if it happens far away and doesn’t affect you directly.”  Patrick came to eastern Ukraine in 2016, two years after the war in eastern Ukraine started, with a humanitarian organization that was working on demining. “When I came to Kramatorsk, the active hostilities had calmed down, and despite its proximity to the front line, Kramatorsk seemed like a peaceful city. There was still this traumatic experience and memory floating in the air. Working in demining, however, I could see every day the scars that Russian invasion was leaving on the land and on people’s lives. “I didn’t believe that a full-scale invasion was possible. I also knew that Ukraine in 2022 was a very different country than in 2014, much stronger and more united.” “Less than a year after that I joined Amnesty International as a Ukraine-focused researcher. I hope I my work will make justice for victims of Russia’s aggression at least a bit more achievable.” Those responsible for gross violations and crimes under international law must be brought to justice.

In celebration of Transgender Day of Visibility on March 31, Amnesty International and Iranti collaborated on a social media campaign, Trans Love Letters, centred around promoting understanding, respect, love, and family shared through stories from transgender and gender-diverse people. Iranti is a Johannesburg-based African regional human rights organisation, using multimedia storytelling, research and advocacy to affirm the human rights of Lesbian, Trans, Non-Binary and Intersex people, Iranti and Amnesty International join the rest of the world in celebrating International Transgender Day of Visibility (TDOV). It’s a day for celebrating trans and gender-diverse people while raising awareness and drawing attention to the challenges, discrimination and injustices trans and gender diverse people continue to face.   Under the theme Trans Love Letters, this is a moment for everyone to pause and reflect on the importance of promoting greater understanding, inclusivity, respect, love, and acceptance of trans and gender-diverse persons. While we celebrate the accomplishments of transgender and gender-diverse people, this is an opportunity to raise awareness of the work that still needs to be done to achieve trans justice around the world.   The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) recognises the inherent dignity, equal and inalienable rights of all people as the foundation of freedom, justice, and peace in the world. However, globally, trans and gender-diverse persons are facing an assault on their rights propelled by increasingly influential anti-rights and anti-gender movements whose aim is to foster hate and exclusion, while promoting a societal norm that pressure people to conform to patriarchal, cisnormativity, heteronormativity, and cisgender stereotypical gender roles. Trans or gender-diverse persons face diverse experiences, their lives are often characterized by deep-rooted structural marginalization and high rates of discrimination, poverty, harassment, violence, and exclusion manifested in their daily lives. The lack of legal recognition of their gender identities and the lack of ability to express themselves and deeply ingrained social norms, harmful gender stereotypes, and, in most countries, discriminatory legislation all serve to keep trans and gender-diverse people invisible and unable to reach their full potential. This goes hand-in-hand with the lack of laws protecting them from the multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination in exercising both their civil, political, social and economic rights such as accessing employment and housing. Visibility means different things to different people, and we call on governments to listen to the voices and experiences of trans and gender-diverse people to understand better what it means for them and how to promote inclusivity and respect for their human rights. States are obliged to promote, protect, and fulfil all people’s rights and for transgender and gender-diverse people this entails efforts from states to combat harmful gender stereotypes leading to discrimination and inequality, and to ensure that culture and tradition are not used to violate or limit trans and gender-diverse people’s human rights. Trans and gender-diverse people are our neighbours, parents, children, friends, family members, and coworkers. We encourage everyone to stand together as champions of trans and gender-diverse people’s inclusion and acceptance, creating a society that represents the beauty and strength of human diversity. Embracing each other’s differences with open hearts and minds, will not only honour our shared humanity but also build a more just and equitable world for us all.  Amnesty International and Iranti hope that this year’s Transgender Day of Visibility exemplifies the transformative power of love and acceptance, paving the way for a more inclusive and equitable society where trans and gender-diverse people are celebrated, valued, and embraced. Happy International Day of Trans Visibility to all trans and gender-diverse persons. Love and Solidarity!

Ahmad Khalefa, a Palestinian citizen of Israel, is a lawyer, human rights defender, community organiser and newly elected city council member. On 19 October 2023, Israeli police violently arrested him along with 10 other demonstrators from a peaceful protest in his native town of Umm al-Fahm in northern Israel. He was subsequently charged with “incitement to terrorism” and “identification with a terrorist group,” for chanting slogans against the war in Gaza. After nearly four months in prison, Ahmad Khalefa was put under house arrest under strict terms, including electronic tagging.

0,"Leila de Lima: How I Survived 2,454 Days in Arbitrary Detention",AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2024/03/leila-de-lima-philippines/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? Leila de Lima was jailed under former President Rodrigo Duterte, who led the so-called “war on drugs” that has killed thousands in the Philippines. A Senator at the time, Leila was one of Duterte’s most prominent critics before bogus charges were brought against her using witness testimony that was later retracted in a process that took nearly seven years.  After all that time in arbitrary detention, that included being held hostage by an inmate at knifepoint, former Philippine senator and prisoner of conscience Leila de Lima was finally granted temporary freedom in November 2023. But one charge remains. Here, Leila speaks to Amnesty International about her harrowing ordeal in detention, what helped her get through it and what she plans to do next. The answers have been edited for length and clarity.  Since day one of my release, I’ve been extremely busy. I had to go to a safehouse, upon advice of my friends. I was allowed to see several of my close friends. As I could not check in with my family in person, I had to call them.   I stayed a few days in that safehouse before I went home to our province… it was a very emotional reunion. My [91-year-old] mom never knew that I was in jail. What my siblings told her was just that I was on a study leave in the US.   A lot of people came to our house to visit me. Some of them were very emotional. Whenever I meet people in public places, even if they’re total strangers, some of them would be crying and saying, “We prayed for you, Senator Leila. We’re so happy that you’re free at last.”  I was detained for almost seven years – six years, eight months and 21 days to be exact or a total of 2,454 days. I had to develop a strict daily routine to keep myself busy. The first few days, I was so restless with feelings of disbelief and indignation. But eventually I was able to adjust.   From 4:30am when I woke up, I would start praying and reading the Bible and doing some writing. I had no cell phone, no Internet access, no laptop or any other electronic gadget, no aircon, no shower. I was allowed to have a microwave oven because I had no private kitchen or stove and since my food came from my house, I needed a way to reheat it.   I adopted almost 20 stray cats who kept on coming to my quarters. Five of those were my favourites and these are the ones I brought home upon my release. These cats were so helpful with me coping with my life in detention. They were so important to me because they kept my sanity intact. They made me happy in spite of the solitude, the feeling of being so alone.  I was praying the rosary when I was taken hostage on 9 October, 2022. It was part of my routine, between 6:20 and 6:30 am. I was midway through my rosary when somebody just barged into my room, one of the three detainees who were attempting to escape. The two were earlier gunned down, I didn’t know that there was already something happening outside.  One of them was able to escape the sniper so he got to my room and took me as hostage with an improvised knife constantly being pressed on my chest. I was blindfolded, my hands and feet were tied. When his demands were not being met, he told me, “It’s time. I will kill you and then I’ll kill myself.”    I was blindfolded the whole time, then all of a sudden there were shots, close-range shots, three or four shots. I never saw the hostage-taker fall because I was immediately taken out of my room. It was very traumatic, very harrowing. I thought it was my end. Even if I was truly scared, I had to show to the hostage-taker that I was not.  It was very traumatic, very harrowing. I thought it was my end. Even if I was truly scared, I had to show to the hostage-taker that I was not. When he was asking for my cell phone, I told him, “I have no cell phone, that’s prohibited, you know that.” I was trying to fight off fear. Because if it’s the other way around, if you’re overwhelmed with fear, then you won’t be able to think straight. That’s my whole attitude.   Before the pandemic, I received regular visits.   But then when the pandemic struck, there was a total lockdown for several months. Even when the lockdown was lifted, there was still limited visits allowed. They imposed more restrictions. Visitors became infrequent because of additional requirements like seeking court permission. Until my release on 13 November 2023, visitations were limited.   I was blessed and fortunate that the whole world was watching. Otherwise, it would have been more difficult for me. The authorities knew that the world was watching. A lot of organizations like Amnesty International and members of parliament were closely monitoring my case and issuing statements calling for my immediate freedom. It meant a lot.   Fortunately, the custodial guards treated me fairly well, with respect, with courtesy and professionalism, with distance of course.  It was a difficult experience, mentally, physically and emotionally, especially [because] I’m innocent. I had to cope with the circumstances. The other option was to surrender. I was just fighting for the rights of those victimized by the drug war, for justice. I needed to survive because I don’t want to give my oppressors and persecutors the satisfaction of seeing me broken or destroyed.   There were blessings because of the solitude. Solitude brings out a lot of things in you, makes you realize a lot of things. You miss your loved ones, missed milestones, missed opportunities, especially when friends or relatives or family would pass away. I could not even visit their wake.   I realized the beauty of small blessings in life. Whenever it’s raining, I would be in the door of my quarters and just stare at the rain. And then the birds, when they come in the morning, I would feed them. I never did those things before. My focus was on something else. These are blessings, moments of epiphany.   I realized the beauty of small blessings in life. It was difficult, but it was all worth it. I have no regrets whatsoever. I persevered in fighting for the rights of others. I realized that worthy things are never easy to achieve. But I dared oppose those wrongful deaths, those wrongful policies of the past administration. You can never go wrong when it comes to human rights and upholding human dignity.   I will be suing those behind my detention. They must face their day of reckoning for what they did to me. They knew that all those accusations are false, made-up and plain fabrications, but they pursued them, filing those three drug cases. I could not just let it pass. It’s not a matter of revenge. It’s a matter of justice. I was a clear victim of injustice.   Their whole idea is to silence me, to destroy me. The whole state apparatus went after me on orders of Mr Duterte. All of this was orchestrated to satisfy the pleasure of a vindictive president.   I intend to pursue my core advocacies – human rights and social justice, democracy and rule of law. I am closely monitoring the developments in the ICC [International Criminal Court] investigation of the drug war killings.   There’s still more to do. There are still reports of killings but fewer in number. I want President Marcos Jr. to make an explicit, categorical and public announcement telling those responsible, whether state actors or not – to stop it. We have not heard it from him. What can be more powerful than getting it from the President himself saying, “Just stop the killings”?   Every year, our global community comes together to fight injustice and support people whose human rights are under threat.

0,Financing constraints on the right to education – what is the role of debt?,AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2024/03/financing-constraints-on-the-right-to-education-what-is-the-role-of-debt/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? In January 2024, Aljazeera reported that global debt – public and private combined – had reached a record USD 307 billion in 2023. For African governments debt is at its highest since 2001. Sovereign debt in sub-Saharan Africa averages almost 60% of GDP. At least 23 low-income African countries face a debt crisis with the service bill on external debt over USD 68 billion. Along with rising total debt, interest and repayments have shot up – affecting governments’ ability to finance the human rights needs of their populations. In 2022, Save the Children reported debt as one of the key concerns regarding the ability of states to fulfil obligations on the right to education.   As shown in our 2023 Debt and the Right to Health blog series, increasing debt burdens on governments are crowding out much needed expenditure in areas such as health, education and social protection. Low and middle-income developing countries face constraints from all sides. Low tax bases with regressive systems, corruption, rising inflation, weakening exchange rates and slow economic growth add to rising interest costs. Prolonged recovery from Covid-19 and increasing costs related to climate change compound the debt and the right to education problem.  In recent years, international pressure by both multilateral and bilateral creditors, including IFIs, has been placed on African countries to review and renegotiate their external debts to both avoid default and address their sustainable development goal (SDG) commitments. SDG 4 (of 17) covers education and the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) estimates the current annual funding gap to meet this goal by all countries by 2030 is USD 100 billion, of which USD 70 billion is for sub-Saharan Africa. The right to education is captured in SDG 4, but because education has a positive impact on several other development areas, it also affects targets under a number of other goals including 3, 5, 8, 12 and 13. This is also reflected in UNESCO’s Constitution when it states that education is a “sacred duty” given its positive impact on human well-being.  Yet according to UNESCO’s 2023 Global Education Monitoring (GEM) report, total spending on education by government and donors declined across all country income groups in 2021. It was only in low-income countries that government spending did not decline, but these countries are likely reliant on budget support and direct donor funding to supplement education financing – which did decline. Since Covid-19, general budget support from aid has continued to decline with increased aid going to addressing growing refugee numbers. UNESCO reports that over the period reviewed (2020 – 2021), aid to education fell by 7%. In this context UNESCO estimates that it is families and households that have had to step up to cover education fees during this shortfall – contributing more than one third of education expenditure in low and lower-middle income countries. However, this will have had an impact on the incomes of those families, reducing the amount of money they have to spend on other essentials such as food, energy, housing, etc.  The right to education is extensively recognised and guaranteed under international and regional human rights law. Article 26 of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights guarantees the right to free and compulsory elementary education. This provision is further elaborated by Article 13 of the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights which emphasizes the state’s obligation to guarantee the right to free and compulsory primary education, together with the obligation to make secondary education ‘generally available and accessible’. Article 17 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights along with child-specific instruments such as the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (Articles 28 and 29) and the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child (Article 11) also emphasize the state’s obligation to guarantee free and compulsory basic education. Other related education provisions are found in Article 5(e)(v) of the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination; Article 8(1) of the Declaration on the Right to Development; Article 24 of the Convention on the Rights of Person with Disabilities; Part III of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women; and national constitutions and legislation. The Abidjan Principles as well as various UN Human Rights Committees have clarified specific aspects of the right to education such as the role of private actors.   In realising the right to education, it is important to define its content and assess progress accordingly. General Comment No. 13 (1999), the Committee on Social, Economic and Cultural Rights (CESCR) has emphasized that the right to education must exhibit acceptability, adaptability, accessibility, and availability all of which require adequate resourcing. Furthermore, the state is legally obliged to progressively respect, protect and fulfil these features regarding the right to education. State parties are legally required to make primary education compulsory, and free to all, as a matter of priority, while taking steps to realise secondary, tertiary, and other fundamental education for all. This, according to the Committee on the Rights of the Child, requires adequate state budgeting.   The human rights framework and other international agreements have taken steps to support states in financing education. In General Comment No. 13, paragraph 60 outlines the obligations of non- state actors to ensure efforts to realise the right to education are coordinated stating “the international financial institutions, notably the World Bank and IMF, should pay greater attention to the protection of the right to education in their lending policies, credit agreements, structural adjustment programmes and measures taken in response to the debt crisis”.   The 2015 Incheon Declaration for the implementation of SDG4 commits all states to increased domestic resource mobilisation and specifically an allocation of between 4 and 6 % of GDP and/or 15 to 20 % of total public expenditure to financing education. In support of this process developed states also reaffirmed their original MDG commitment to provide 0.7% of gross national income (GNI) to overseas development assistance for developing countries and 0.15 to 0.2% of GNI to least developed countries. This was also agreed at the third Financing for Development conference in July 2015. Previously, the Dakar Framework for Action on Education (2000) had committed sub-Saharan African governments to budget 7% of GDP within 5 years of the declaration, and 9% within 10 years. The 2023 GEM report indicates the current annual average for sub-Saharan Africa is 3.4% of GDP, rising to an estimated 4.6% by 2030.  With Education the African Union’s 2024 theme, there will hopefully be renewed impetus for African states to better resource this critical public service and ensure that all children and young people have access to a decent education. It is within this spirit that this series will provide a snapshot of the debt position and performance on public spending on education in four countries in East and Southern Africa.

0,"Remembering Cao Shunli, an inspiring Chinese activist",AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2024/03/remembering-cao-shunli-the-inspiring-chinese-activist/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? It is 10 years since the death of human rights activist Cao Shunli, who passed away on 14 March 2014 after being denied medical treatment while detained by the Chinese authorities. She had been arrested at a Beijing airport six months earlier while attempting to travel to Geneva to attend a session of UN Human Rights Council. A decade on, no one has been held accountable for her death.This article, by Amnesty International’s former China Campaigner*, was originally published five days after Cao Shunli’s death.   In late August 2013, I spoke to Cao Shunli on the phone. I never imagined it would be the last time we’d talk. We had made plans to meet a few weeks later in Hong Kong when she travelled through the city en route to Geneva, where she was due to attend a human rights training programme. We had spoken many times but that was going to be the first time we’d actually meet. We never got the chance. Cao disappeared when she went to check in at Beijing Capital International Airport. The Chinese authorities detained her for “picking quarrels and provoking trouble”. She remained in detention, where she died last Friday. Throughout the past six months the authorities repeatedly denied Cao the medical treatment she clearly needed. Sadness and anger were my overriding emotions on hearing she had died. Sadness that such a courageous woman had lost her life. Anger at how callous and calculating the authorities had been in their disregard for her life. Far from “provoking trouble” the Cao I knew did not seek confrontation. All she wanted was for the government to recognize the legitimate rights of its citizens. A gentle woman in her early fifties, Cao was softly spoken but with a steely determination to fight injustice. We did all we could to pressure the Chinese authorities to ensure Cao received the right medical care, but our calls were ignored. She could have chosen an easier life. She had a good government job but could not turn a blind eye to the corruption in her department. Her efforts weren’t appreciated by her bosses and she lost her job in 2002. Cao then took up the cause of China’s thousands of petitioners, who are at best seen as a nuisance by the authorities. Their rights are frequently trampled on with many detained for spells in secret jails or sent to labour camps. Having studied law at university, Cao had a good knowledge of the legal avenues to fight injustice. This expertise combined with an unyielding commitment for change was a potent combination. One the authorities feared because she inspired so many within China to claim their rights. Cao had a relentless energy and always wanted to discuss new ideas and initiatives. She was meticulous in preparing documents and evidence. She pressed hard for the public to be allowed to contribute to a human rights report China is required to submit to the UN. In June last year, with her efforts repeatedly denied, she organized a protest outside the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Beijing. For nearly 90 days and nights, this group of middle-aged and elderly women camped outside the Ministry. Cao constantly used her negotiation skills with the police to ensure the protest could continue. The group became a second family to Cao. She drew strength from their friendship and solidarity. Cao also valued the international support from Amnesty International and others. She wanted to draw attention to the campaign outside China. It may seem bizarre that Cao was prepared to risk her life to contribute to a report for the UN. But for Cao this was far bigger. This was about the government respecting the legitimate rights of the people. For individuals to be treated as citizens with the right to participate in shaping China’s future. Having spent two previous periods in labour camps for her campaigning, there was always a risk she would be detained this time. The Chinese government is particularly sensitive to criticism on the international stage. We talked about this, and she said she was aware of the risks and prepared for the consequences. But I don’t think anyone expected that the authorities would be so cruel as to effectively take her life. We did all we could to pressure the authorities to ensure she received the right medical care. But this time our calls were ignored. I often ask myself if I would be prepared to risk my life for human rights as Cao, and many others in China have, and will continue to. The honest answer is I don’t know. But this mild-mannered woman, whose sense of justice shone through in all our conversations, will remain an inspiration to me in the struggle for human rights in China. *Name withheld for security reasons.

Opposition politicians Jaouhar Ben Mbarek, Khayyam Turki, Issam Chebbi, Ghazi Chaouachi, Ridha Belhaj and Abdelhamid Jelassi have been arbitrarily detained since February 2023 on unfounded “conspiracy against state security” accusations. In January 2024, a judge rejected the latest appeals against the prolonged pre-trial detention of the six detainees submitted by the Committee for the Defence of Political Detainees.

0,Three prominent women reveal why sexual and reproductive rights are a major human rights issue,AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2024/03/three-prominent-women-reveal-why-sexual-and-reproductive-rights-are-a-major-human-rights-issue/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? Thirty years ago, the Cairo Conference and Programme of Action marked a seminal moment for the sexual and reproductive rights movement and its recognition in international law as a human rights issue. This International Women’s Day, three women who attended the conference reflect on that pivotal moment in 1994, why sexual and reproductive rights matter to them, and what still needs to be done to protect sexual and reproductive rights.  Charlotte was the founding Director of the Center for Women’s Global Leadership (CWGL) at Rutgers University and is a Distinguished Professor Emeritus in Women’s and Gender Studies. She has worked as an activist, writer, and organizer in feminist, LGBT, and human rights movements for over five decades and is currently on the Board of the Urgent Action Fund for Feminist Activism. What were your hopes for women’s rights when you attended the Cairo conference in 1994?My primary focus and hope at the Cairo Conference was to have women’s reproductive rights recognized as human rights issues. We had succeeded at the World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna in 1993 in getting a broad acknowledgment that “women’s rights are human rights” and therefore wanted Cairo to make this principle concrete in relation to women’s control over their bodies. We also sought to frame the development part of the Cairo conference on population and development as a human rights question as part of our women’s rights North-South collaboration.30 years on, how do you feel about the state of women’s reproductive rights in your country?In many ways, women’s reproductive rights in the United States have expanded over this past 30 years, but this continues to be a major battle in the country, especially with the right-wing taking control of the Republican Party. The recent US Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade, which had made abortion a constitutional right, has been a major setback for this issue. But it has also put it at the centre of political debate in the country. I am optimistic in the long run that most women (and many men) in the US do want these rights and will vote to have them restored. Can you share a personal anecdote about why this issue matters to you?I grew up in a small town in New Mexico and saw what happened to a couple of my good friends when they became pregnant in the early 1960s before birth control pills and abortion were readily available. They had to leave high school without graduating and their life dreams were derailed. Like many women my age, I feared getting pregnant when I had sex even with birth control as I saw what they experienced. It left a lasting impression on me about why this issue is so crucial to women’s opportunities in life. What needs to change to ensure girls and women globally can access sexual and reproductive rights?Feminist women and men have to gain more power politically around the globe. We have to convince more people that this is a fundamental human right to control one’s own body and that it’s crucial to the ability of women to exercise many of their other social, economic and political human rights.  Leila is a transnational feminist leader, strategist, and advisor with over 25 years of organizing, advocacy and philanthropic experience advancing human rights, gender equality, and sexual and reproductive rights and justice. Born in Algeria, Leila currently serves as a Senior International Fellow at the Asfari Institute for Civil Society and Citizenship at the American University of Beirut in Lebanon. She also works as Senior Strategist for organizations including the Urgent Action Fund-Africa and Trust Africa, promoting an initiative on Reimagining Feminist and Pan-African Philanthropies. What were your hopes for women’s rights when you attended the Cairo conference in 1994?I was fortunate to move to Cairo in 1993 to work with the steering committee for the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD). As part of my role, I met with women’s networks from across the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) to discuss national and regional perspectives for its Programme of Action. While there were differences across the perspectives and strategies of the global feminist movement, we united around key areas that we knew we wanted to influence to shift from a population control approach to one grounded in women’s rights, poverty elimination and sustainable development.  Since the ICPD was held in Cairo, it was important to uplift the rich and diverse history, realities, and current struggles of feminist movements across the MENA region as these are often not recognized in the global North, purposely ignored or silenced. The ICPD Programme of Action was a landmark document in many ways because it centred language that feminists advocated for, which included an intersectional human rights approach to women’s sexual and reproductive health, poverty elimination and economic development.  30 years on, how do you feel about the state of women’s reproductive rights globally?Since the ICPD, more than 60 countries have reformed their abortion laws, including recent efforts to decriminalize and liberalize abortion in Colombia, Argentina, Mexico and Benin. However, four countries, including the United States, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Poland, have curtailed abortion rights. The United States’ position on abortion is out of line with global trends and is a true disgrace — especially for a country that considers itself a democracy. Women around the world know that the feminist struggle to dismantle sexism and male power and ensure that women have opportunities in life will not be achieved until all women have control over their sexual and reproductive lives. A truly democratic and just world is one where abortion is considered an integral part of women’s and human lives and a common and normal practice over which women have power and control. Why does this issue matter to you?Over my lifetime, I have needed abortions, I have accompanied others who needed abortions, I have given birth to two beautiful daughters, I have parented my own children, and I have supported others to parent, all of which are core to my humanity, my life and my reproductive rights.What needs to change to ensure girls and women globally can access sexual and reproductive rights?We need deep and radical change that begins with valuing all girls and women, including those who identify as trans, non-binary, and gender non-conforming. This must be supported by deep and systemic change at multiple levels of the ecosystem — individual, institutional, sectoral — to ensure that all women and girls benefit from a broad range of accessible, acceptable, affordable and available sexual and reproductive services and rights. Marge was the founding editor of the journal Reproductive Health Matters from 1992-2015 and coordinator and newsletter editor of the International Campaign for Women’s Right to Safe Abortion from 2015-2023 and will continue to publish the newsletter in 2024. She chaired the first Gender Advisory Panel at the World Health Organization from 1996-2001 and became an Honorary Associate Professor at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine in 2022.   What were your hopes for women’s rights when you attended the Cairo conference in 1994?Many of us had very high hopes that the meeting would endorse a wide range of women’s rights in relation to sexual and reproductive health, and indeed that happened. A large international group of feminists, coordinated by Adrienne Germain of the International Women’s Health Coalition, held a strategy meeting in Brazil in 1992 and a lot of other non-governmental groups, as well as UN agencies, including WHO and UNFPA, actively participated in the Cairo conference to promote women’s rights issues. But the opposition to the right to safe abortion on the part of many governments was present at the conference, and when it was addressed, the meeting got bogged down in making a difficult compromise, which continues to have a restrictive influence even today. The so-called “compromise” was that abortion should be safe where it is legal, yet lack of safety occurs mainly where abortion is illegal, and that it should not be used as a method of family planning, even though that is often what abortion is used for when contraception fails or is not used. The intention of the latter was that abortion should be used only in cases of risk to health and life. Both of these “compromises” claimed to greatly restrict the permissible grounds. 30 years on, how do you feel about the state of women’s reproductive rights in your country?In the UK, sexual and reproductive health services have steadily improved. In Northern Ireland, the abortion law was finally changed after the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) was called in to make a ruling. But in the USA (I’m a dual national) the situation in relation to abortion is akin to a civil war between states dominated by anti-abortion politics and states dominated by pro-choice politics, with an anti-abortion Supreme Court, and the rule of law and women’s rights are being violated in a myriad of ways. Why does this issue matter to you?I had a relationship with a refugee who was learning English in the school where I taught. One night he had no condoms. Aww, he said, one time won’t matter. But it did, I got pregnant. At which point he told me he was married with four children in his home country, and I never heard from him again. This is not an unusual story. What needs to change to ensure girls and women globally can access sexual and reproductive rights?Respect for girls and women and support for all sexual and reproductive rights via laws, policies and services so that they have the autonomy and means to have the children they want and not be forced to have the children they do not want and cannot cope with, whatever their reasons.

On 26 January, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) found that Palestinian civilians in the occupied Gaza Strip face a real and imminent risk of genocide. Pending its final ruling on the allegations of genocide brought by South Africa against Israel under the Genocide Convention, the Court ordered six provisional measures, including for Israel to take all measures within its power to prevent the commission of all acts proscribed by the Genocide Convention and to ensure the provision of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance to civilians in Gaza. However, Israeli forces continue to intensify their cataclysmic assault on the occupied Gaza Strip, threaten land operations in Rafah, maintain a near-total illegal and inhuman siege, and obstruct the entry of desperately needed humanitarian aid.

Human rights activists jailed in mainland China and Hong Kong will not be able to see their loved ones this Valentine’s Day. Here, the partners of three detained activists write love letters instead. Human rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng is a victim of enforced disappearance. There is no information about his whereabouts since he was taken away from his home in Yulin City, northwest China, in August 2017. A former prisoner of conscience who was previously tortured in detention, he has been prevented from communicating with his wife Geng He for seven years. Dear Zhisheng, How are you doing? The chilly winters in northern China always concern me when it comes to your health. Without family by your side, how do you manage through these harsh cold days? I yearn to see you, to care for you, and to share warmth with each other. The bitterness of our separation for 16 years makes each day a struggle, and every piece of news about you feels precious, especially considering our last communication was seven years ago. Do you still recall? Thirty-four years of knowing and loving each other, believing in our lifelong commitment to one another. Yet fate has driven us apart, leaving us to hold onto faith and the image of a complete family in our hearts. As the Spring Festival approaches and Valentine’s Day draws near, on such occasions, I wish you could suddenly appear before me, and our family could be reunited. Zhisheng, despite the hardships, our family has become the strongest in the world. The children and I will bravely endure until the day you return. Please stay strong as well, no matter the challenges you face, please come back to us. We will always wait for you and love you forever. Your wife, Geng He Lawyer Chow Hang-tung is detained in Hong Kong over her role in organizing the city’s Tiananmen crackdown vigil, for which she faces up to 10 years in jail under the National Security Law. Her partner and fellow activist, Ye Du, is living under police surveillance in the Chinese city of Guangzhou. I have never had the chance to spend Valentine’s Day with Hang-tung. When we first got together, I couldn’t leave the country, and by the time I could, she couldn’t enter. We never managed to be together for Valentine’s Day, so we cherish the brief moments we can share even more. When you truly love someone, every day feels like Valentine’s Day. Since the summer of 2019 until now, I’ve been unable to leave the country, and she’s now in prison, with no prospect of us meeting, let alone spending Valentine’s Day together. In 2021, we exchanged Valentine’s Day gifts for the last time before she lost her freedom. Knowing she often strains her eyes by reading on her phone, I ordered a Kindle for her from an online store in Hong Kong to be delivered to her office. She bought me a cotton towel blanket and had it sent from Hong Kong to Guangzhou via Hong Kong Post. We both wished to spend Valentine’s Day like any other couple, enjoying the scenery together under the moonlight. However, in this era where freedom and dignity are trampled upon, we had to choose to bear the weight and move forward. Our shared love gave us the courage and strength to press on. People always say that love must withstand tests, but when the storms come, most relationships falter. Now, she is in a prison in Hong Kong, and every time I speak out or write about her in mainland China, I am invariably summoned and questioned. Yet, the tests imposed by authoritarian power have never crushed our love. Despite the distance and obstacles, our yearning for each other never ceases. In this lifetime, we will not betray our freedom or each other. Ye Du Human rights lawyer Ding Jiaxi was convicted last year of “subversion of state power” and sentenced to 12 years in prison. He has been subjected to torture and other ill-treatment in detention, essentially for meeting with others to discuss the civil society situation and current affairs in China. Ding’s wife, Shengchun, was only informed of his current whereabouts in February 2024. Dear Jiaxi, I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve penned these letters, unsure of when they can be delivered to you. Since your second arrest on December 26, 2019, this physical letter marks the 60th, though in truth, there have been countless others I’ve wished to write but was too preoccupied to set down. Each Sunday, after returning home from church, I feel an overwhelming urge to write to you, much like today. It’s as if I can’t help but imagine you seated beside me during the service. Whenever the pastor’s sermon moves me, I find myself silently asking, “Dear Jiaxi, do you feel the same?” Since my baptism, I’ve often wished to discuss faith with you. It’s unfortunate that we never found the time for such conversations before your arrest. Today’s sermon focused on heeding and responding to God’s call, underscoring the hardships and challenges one must endure to fulfill His mission—an inspiring message that lifted my spirits. In the past month, I’ve forged many new friendships, predominantly with young people, some of whom are the same age as our daughter. Engaging with them has been intellectually stimulating and brings me joy. Today, we delved into a meaningful discussion on women’s rights, which broadened my perspectives significantly. Each day, I remind myself that happiness is a vital precursor to success. Your words, “Be happy and joyful as a citizen,” still resonate with me. To shield my family from potential harassment by national security, I’ve refrained from asking them to visit you, making letter-writing our sole means of gauging your well-being and eagerly awaiting your response. May the Lord watch over and protect you, granting you health and safety.

0,­­­What is Tor and how does it advance human rights?,AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2024/02/what-is-tor-and-how-does-it-advance-human-rights/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? Our right to privacy and open information online is more at risk than ever before. Governments use spyware to target human rights defenders and block entire websites that talk about human rights. In fact, Amnesty’s websites are completely blocked to people living in countries like Russia, Iran and China, just because we dare to confront human rights violations in those countries. Luckily there are people out there looking for ways to combat this threat. This includes the Tor Project, a non-profit organization that builds technology that helps you stay safe online. Tor is an acronym for ‘The Onion Router’ and has software that makes it incredibly difficult to track what you do online. It is like having a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or private browser but even more secure.  When you use Tor Browser or Tor-specific onion services, information about your movements online is scrambled across a global network of relays run by volunteers with The Tor Project. This means that there are multiple layers of encryption protecting your privacy, just like there are many layers in an onion. Before we can explain what sets Tor Browser apart from other browsers, we should first cover the basics of how normal browsers work. Normal browsers like Chrome, or Safari or Firefox search for websites using DNS or the Domain Name System. DNS uses a distributed network of systems to locate the web server that houses the website you’re looking for. Your device will then make a direct connection to that web server. That web server and internet routers that you used to reach that server have your IP address, since that is how they knew where to send the content. It’s similar to the way we send physical letters through the post. Your letter goes through a series of post offices before it finally reaches its destination. And just like you have a return address on a letter, your IP address is included in the information being passed around. This is where privacy becomes an issue. You leave traces of your IP address across the internet when you’re browsing, which makes it possible to track someone’s online activity without them knowing. Using a Tor browser hides your IP address by putting it through multiple levels of encryption and Tor network relay points before sending any information to the website you are visiting, thus making browsing safer and more private. The most secure and private connection you can make using Tor is with websites that are published on an .onion domain. These websites are created inside the Tor network and are end-to-end encrypted, meaning that there is no information being passed through the public internet after leaving the Tor network.   In 2023, we started publishing our research and campaigns on an .onion domain, enabling our supporters to better access human rights information without compromising their privacy. While the Tor browser is a great way to avoid sharing your IP address while online, there are still risks to using the normal infrastructure of the Internet. Even though your IP address is hidden, the network likely knows that you’re using Tor, which could present its own challenges.  To combat this Tor also provides Bridges that make it more difficult for anyone watching your internet traffic to determine that you are using Tor. You can use Tor by downloading the Tor Browser, which works the same way other browsers do except it’s connected to the Tor network. We all have a right to privacy. That right is well documented in laws around the world, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. And yet we still hear reports of states using unlawful and pervasive surveillance systems to track internet browsing and the use of messaging applications. Governments also use highly-invasive spyware and targeted surveillance systems to spy on people who speak against them. These risks don’t only affect the most vocal human rights defenders. In 2021, The Pegasus Project unveiled the truth that spyware from surveillance company NSO Group was used to target as many as 50,000 phones on behalf of their government clients. We have joined global calls for an end to this kind of invasive and systematic surveillance but know that these programmes continue to remain a serious threat. That’s why initiatives like Tor are so crucial to combatting today’s surveillance harms. Tor provides an alternate route to the web that allows people to benefit from open and free information without being forced to compromise their privacy.   Every year, our global community comes together to fight injustice and support people whose human rights are under threat.

In 2007, Kacey Keeton, a 49-year-old lawyer from Alabama, was assigned the case of Rocky Myers, a Black man who has spent nearly three decades on death row. In this wide-ranging Q&A, she details the multiple injustices he has faced, why the use of nitrogen hypoxia is hugely disturbing, and why she’s determined to fight for Rocky’s commutation. I have wanted to be a lawyer since I was five years old. My mother has it documented in a journal. Of course, I think the next year I wanted to be a teacher, then a circus performer, then a journalist, and so on over the years — but somehow, I arrived back at lawyer by the time college graduation came around. In all variations of my life as a lawyer, I have been lucky enough to always be able to help people. And, helping people is why I became a lawyer. I specifically felt a calling to work with death row populations. I believe those on death row are often left out of conversations when it comes to support and help. They are people that have often never had anyone stand up for them, and I am grateful to be doing this work with them. Doing this work in Alabama is truly operating on the front lines, where the most help is needed. Working for people incarcerated on death row is incredibly rewarding, but it can also be stressful and disheartening. It is disheartening to see injustices in the system result in human beings being killed by the State. It is disheartening to know that no matter how hard you work to help someone, it may not be enough. But the people we represent make this job worthwhile. It is an amazing thing to see someone who has been through so much still have hope and still believe in the goodness of others. Their hope and belief inspire me every day. I was assigned Rocky’s case in November 2007. He had been a client of our office since March 2004. I met Rocky for the first time in February 2008. When our office began representing Rocky, he had been abandoned by prior counsel during his state post-conviction appeals. That abandonment left Rocky in the position of having his ability to pursue a federal appeal procedurally defaulted. Due to procedural rules, there was no federal court that heard his claims for relief, including his claims of innocence and intellectual disability. Had his attorney filed the appropriate appeals at the state level, Rocky would have been able to pursue his claims in federal court that his conviction and death sentence, which was ordered by a circuit court judge’s judicial override, were unjust. With that backdrop, I knew that helping Rocky would require a Court to excuse the default. So, coming into his case, I was well aware that the deck was stacked against him — even more than normal with someone on death row. Having read the record, there were also so many things that made me realize his was an unjust conviction and sentence. The first time I met Rocky, he was very quiet and did not interact with me a great deal. I visited him with another attorney who he did know and so I mostly sat in the background and observed their interactions. We didn’t talk much about his case during our first few visits. I knew from others that it would take a while to build his trust and wanted to take that time to just get to know one another. I also wanted to take it slower because I was aware of Rocky’s intellectual disability and needed to make sure that he understood fully everything we communicated. I was lucky to have a great team on his case with whom he already had relationships. So, it definitely made it easier to develop a bond with him. Rocky has long carried shame over where he is and the status of his legal case. He blames his struggle with drugs for being in a situation where he could be a suspect in a case like this. He blames his struggle with drugs for not being there for his family. He has not used drugs since the time of his arrest in 1991, and he uses his time now often to talk to others about the danger of dependence. When Rocky’s state post-conviction attorney abandoned him mid-appeal, Rocky had no idea it had happened. He presumed everything was moving along. It wasn’t until he received a letter from the Attorney General that he learned his right to appeal had expired and that Alabama was moving to set an execution date. Because of his reading ability, Rocky wasn’t even able to read that letter — a friend of his on the row read it to him. They helped him reach out and get counsel to try and fix this problem. Rocky has long blamed himself for not knowing that he had been abandoned by counsel. Yet, Rocky remains hopeful. He is a man of deep faith and he is a praying man. He is a sports fan. He loves music. And he tells many stories about his siblings and growing up. He loves getting mail and talks about the beautiful postcards he gets from people that share where they are. He posts many of the pictures on his wall and imagines himself there. He often uses the pictures to “take him away” from problems or stressful things going on. He has been particularly blessed by outreach from Amnesty International members and because of postcard campaigns they have sponsored. Rocky doesn’t want to die. He has said that he gets sick to his stomach every time something comes up about nitrogen hypoxia and executions. The recent execution of Kenny Smith has made this new method a frightening reality. It is clear from reports of witnesses that Kenny suffered before he died. That this occurred to a man who the State had terrorized a year earlier with a botched execution attempt, and a man whose jury voted to give a life sentence, like Rocky, is even more horrific. We can only hope that the problems that occurred with Kenny’s execution make Alabama take a step back and consider what they are doing. There are many injustices in Rocky’s case. From the start, Rocky was arrested and charged with little evidence other than the word of witnesses who had previously implicated someone else. As a poor Black man, he was subject to appointed counsel because Alabama does not have a statewide public defender system. Poor people are assigned counsel by elected judges. In his case, Rocky was assigned an attorney who previously regularly represented the Ku Klux Klan. Rocky was then given a jury of his supposed peers, a jury consisting of 11 white people and 1 Black person. The opening statements of Rocky’s own counsel prejudiced him from the start. His own counsel talked about the area where he lived as being “the very pit of hell”. Counsel failed to fully challenge the case at trial and created division between the jury and his own client with statements like those from the outset. In the end, the jury of 11 whites convicted Rocky, but they voted to spare his life by recommending life without parole. Because of Alabama law at the time, the single elected judge was able to override that and sentence Rocky to death. That process is no longer allowed in Alabama, but the legislature failed to make it retroactive, leaving Rocky and others on death row. In Rocky’s case this feels particularly egregious because we know from speaking with one of the jurors that there was a disagreement among them. There were a group of jurors that believed Rocky was not guilty, but they reached a compromise with the other jurors to vote to convict — if they agreed to sentence him to life. Rocky’s is a case where an intellectually disabled Black man was disadvantaged from the start because of poverty and a broken justice system.  Rocky’s is a case where an intellectually disabled Black man was disadvantaged from the start because of poverty and a broken justice system. His counsel failed to take into account or raise his intellectual disability, which created problems in the case. Race, poverty, and inequality all operated to create multiple unjust situations in Rocky’s case, and in countless others. When Rocky lost his last appeal, he told me that he did not want clemency. He said he was tired, and he didn’t want to beg anyone for his life. I told him that he was in luck because I would be doing the begging and it didn’t bother me. But, a much more serious conversation followed. I told him that clemency was mostly something on paper in Alabama, that it had only been granted once — to a white lady on the Governor’s last day in office. I told him that I hoped and prayed he would get clemency, but that I was not going to lie to him about the odds. I also told him that if he would let us pursue clemency on his behalf that we would tell his story to anyone we could get to listen. We would tell people about all of the things that went wrong in his case. And we have been telling his story. Rocky and each of us on his legal team are hopeful Rocky’s story will help people understand the problems with the justice system in Alabama, in the USA. We also hope it will help stop other stories like Rocky’s from happening. Our plan is to continue fighting for Rocky’s life. We continue to push for others to join that fight and we continue to try and educate people about the injustices in Rocky’s case and in far too many cases in Alabama.

0,Alex: “My approach to technology is informed by political struggles”,AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2024/01/my-approach-to-technology-is-informed-by-political-struggles/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? The increasing number of spyware scandals across Europe and around the world were an alarm bell for Alex, a 31-year-old Romanian activist working at the intersection of human rights, technology and public policy. Seeking to use her experience and knowledge of tech for political change, Alex applied and was accepted onto the Digital Forensics Fellowship led by the Security Lab at Amnesty Tech. The Digital Forensics Fellowship (DFF) is an opportunity for human rights defenders (HRDs) working at the nexus of human rights and technology and expand their learning. Here, Alex shares her activism journey and insight into how like-minded human rights defenders can join the fight against spyware. In the summer of 2022, I watched a recording of Claudio Guarnieri, former Head of the Amnesty Tech Security Lab, presenting about Security Without Borders at the 2016 Chaos Communication Congress. After following the investigations of the Pegasus Project and other projects centring on spyware being used on journalists and human rights defenders, his call to action at the end — “Find a cause and assist others” — resonated with me long after I watched the talk. A few days later, Amnesty Tech announced the launch of the Digital Forensics Fellowship (DFF). It was serendipity, and I didn’t question it. At that point, I had already pushed myself to seek out a more political, more involved way to share my knowledge. Not tech for the sake of tech, but tech activism to ensure political change. I followed an atypical path for a technologist. Prior to university, I dreamt of being a published fiction author, only to switch to studying industrial automation in college. I spent five years as a developer in the IT industry and two as Chief Technology Officer for an NGO, where I finally found myself using my tech knowledge to support journalists and activists. My approach to technology, like my approach to art, is informed by political struggles, as well as the questioning of how one can lead a good life. My advocacy for digital rights follows this thread. For me, technology is merely one of many tools at the disposal of humanity, and it should never be a barrier to decent living, nor an oppressive tool for anyone. Technology is merely one of many tools at the disposal of humanity. It should never be a barrier to decent living, nor an oppressive tool for anyone. The opportunity offered by the DFF matched my interests and the direction I wanted to take my activism. During the year-long training programme from 2022-2023, the things I learned turned out to be valuable for my advocacy work. In 2022, the Child Sexual Abuse Regulation was proposed in the EU. I focused on conducting advocacy to make it as clear as possible that losing encrypted communication would make life decidedly worse for everyone in the EU. We ran a campaign to raise awareness of the importance of end-to-end encryption for journalists, activists and people in general. Our communication unfolded under the banner of “you don’t realize how precious encryption is until you’ve lost it”. Apti.ro, the Romanian non-profit organisation that I work with, also participated in the EU-wide campaign, as part of the EDRi coalition. To add fuel to the fire, spyware scandals erupted across the EU. My home country, Romania, borders countries where spyware has been proven to have been used to invade the personal lives of journalists, political opponents of the government and human rights defenders. The Security Lab provided us with theoretical and practical sessions on digital forensics, while the cohort was a safe, vibrant space to discuss challenges we were facing. We debugged together and discussed awful surveillance technology at length, contributing our own local perspective. The importance of building cross-border networks of cooperation and solidarity became clear to me during the DFF. I heard stories of struggles from people involved in large and small organizations alike. I am convinced our struggles are intertwined, and we should join forces whenever possible. Now when I’m working with other activists, I try not to talk of “forensics”. Instead, I talk about keeping ourselves safe, and our conversations private. Often, discussions we have as activists are about caring for a particular part of our lives – our safety when protesting, our confidentiality when organizing, our privacy when convening online. Our devices and data are part of this process, as is our physical body. At the end of the day, digital forensics are just another form of caring for ourselves. Digital forensics are just another form of caring for ourselves. I try to shape discussions about people’s devices similarly to how doctors discuss the symptoms of an illness. The person whose device is at the centre of the discussion is the best judge of the symptoms, and it’s important to never minimize their apprehension. It’s also important to go through the steps of the forensics in a way that allows them to understand what is happening and what the purpose of the procedure is. I never use a one-size-fits-all approach because the situation of the person who owns a device informs the ways it might be targeted or infected. My work is human-centred and technology-focused and requires care and concentration to achieve meaningful results. For activists interested in working on digital forensics, start by digging deep into the threats you see in in your local context. If numerous phishing campaigns are unfolding, dig into network forensics and map out the owners of the domains and the infrastructure. Secondly, get to know the person you are working with. If they are interested in secure communications, help them gain a better understanding of mobile network-based attacks, as well as suggesting instant messaging apps that preserve the privacy and the security of their users. In time, they will be able to spot “empty words” used to market messaging apps that are not end-to-end encrypted. Finally, to stay true to the part of me that loves a well-told story, read not only reports of ongoing spyware campaigns, but narrative explorations from people involved. “Pegasus: The Story of the World’s Most Dangerous Spyware” by Laurent Richard and Sandrine Rigaud is a good example that documents both the human and the technical aspects. The Shoot the Messenger podcast, by PRX and Exile Content Studio, is also great as it focuses on Pegasus, starting from the brutal murder of Jamal Khashoggi to the recent infection of the device of journalist and founder of Meduza, Galina Timchenko. We must continue to do this research, however difficult it may be, and to tell the stories of those impacted by these invasive espionage tactics. Without this work we wouldn’t be making the political progress we’ve seen to stem the development and use of this atrocious technology.

0,The Urgent but Difficult Task of Regulating Artificial Intelligence  ,AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2024/01/the-urgent-but-difficult-task-of-regulating-artificial-intelligence/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? By David Nolan, Hajira Maryam & Michael Kleinman, Amnesty Tech The year 2023 marked a new era of “AI hype”, rapidly steering policy makers towards discussions on the safety and regulation of new artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. The feverish year in tech started with the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022 and ended with a landmark agreement on the EU AI Act being reached. Whilst the final text is still being ironed out in technical meetings over the coming weeks, early signs indicate the western world’s first “AI rulebook” goes someway to protecting people from the harms of AI but still falls short in a number of crucial areas, failing to ensure human rights protections especially for the most marginalised. This came soon after the UK Government hosted an inaugural AI Safety Summit in November 2023, where global leaders, key industry players, and select civil society groups gathered to discuss the risks of AI. Although the growing momentum and debate on AI governance is welcomed and urgently needed, the key question for 2024 is whether these discussions will generate concrete commitments and focus on the most important present-day AI risks, and critically whether it will translate into further substantive action in other jurisdictions. Whilst AI developments do present new opportunities and benefits, we must not ignore the documented dangers posed by AI tools when they are used as a means of societal control, mass surveillance and discrimination. All too often, AI systems are trained on massive amounts of private and public data–data which reflects societal injustices, often leading to biased outcomes and exacerbating inequalities. From predictive policing tools, to automated systems used in public sector decision-making to determine who can access healthcare and social assistance, to monitoring the movement of migrants and refugees, AI has flagrantly and consistently undermined the human rights of the most marginalised in society. Other forms of AI, such as fraud detection algorithms, have also disproportionately impacted ethnic minorities, who have endured devastating financial problems as Amnesty International has already documented, while facial recognition technology has been used by the police and security forces to target racialised communities and entrench Israel’s system of apartheid. So, what makes regulation of AI complex and challenging? First, there is the vague nature of the term AI itself, making efforts to regulate this technology more cumbersome. There is no widespread consensus on the definition of AI because the term does not refer to a singular technology and rather encapsulates a myriad technological applications and methods. The use of AI systems in many different domains across the public and private sector, means a large number of varied stakeholders are involved in its development and deployment, meaning such systems are a product of labour, data, software and financial inputs and any regulation must grapple with upstream and downstream harms. Further, these systems cannot be strictly considered as hardware or software, but rather their impact comes down to the context in which they are developed and implemented and regulation must take this into account. As we enter 2024, now is the time to not only ensure that AI systems are rights respecting by design, but also to guarantee that those who are impacted by these technologies are not only meaningfully involved in decision-making on how AI technology should be regulated, but also that their experiences are continually surfaced and are centred within these discussions. Alongside the EU legislative process, the UK, US, and others, have set out their distinct roadmaps and approach to identifying the key risks AI technologies present, and how they intend to mitigate these. Whilst there are many complexities of these legislative processes, this should not delay any efforts to protect people from the present and future harms of AI, and there are crucial elements that we, at Amnesty, know any proposed regulatory approach must contain. Regulation must be legally binding and center the already documented harms to people subject to these systems. Commitments and principles on the “responsible” development and use of AI–the core of the current pro-innovation regulatory framework being pursued by the UK—do not offer an adequate protection against the risks of emerging technology and must be put on statutory footing. Similarly, any regulation must include broader accountability mechanisms over and above technical evaluations that are being pushed by industry. Whilst these may be a useful string within any regulatory toolkit’s bow, particularly in testing for algorithmic bias, bans and prohibitions cannot be off the table for systems fundamentally incompatible with human rights, no matter how accurate or technically efficacious they purport to be.  Others must learn from the EU process and ensure there are not loopholes for public and private sector players to circumvent regulatory obligations, and removing any exemptions for AI used within national security or law enforcement is critical to achieving this. It is also important that where future regulation limits or prohibits the use of certain AI systems in one jurisdiction, no loopholes or regulatory gaps allow the same systems to be exported to other countries where they could be used to harm the human rights of marginalized groups. This remains a glaring gap in the UK, US, and EU approaches, as they fail to take into account the global power imbalances of these technologies, especially their impact on communities in the Global Majority whose voices are not represented in these discussions. There have already been documented cases of outsourced workers being exploited in Kenya and Pakistan by companies developing AI tools. As we enter 2024, now is the time to not only ensure that AI systems are rights-respecting by design, but also to guarantee that those who are impacted by these technologies are not only meaningfully involved in decision-making on how AI technology should be regulated, but also that their experiences are continually surfaced and are centred within these discussions. More than lip service by lawmakers, we need binding regulation that holds companies and other key industry players to account — and ensures that profits do not come at the expense of human rights protections. International, regional and national governance efforts must complement and catalyse each other, and global discussions must not come at the expense of meaningful national regulation or binding regulatory standards – these are not mutually exclusive. This is the level at which accountability is served—we must learn from past attempts to regulate tech, which means ensuring robust mechanisms are introduced to allow victims of AI-inflicted rights violations to seek justice.

0,Anna: ‘We frequently have to pause our interviews to flee to a bomb shelter’,AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2023/12/we-frequently-have-to-pause-our-interviews-to-flee-to-a-bomb-shelter/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? Anna Wright works as a researcher for Amnesty International on Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova. Anna has recently been researching the impact of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, her home country. In this essay, Anna shares insights into her work and describes a day in the life of an Amnesty researcher working on a field mission. “As a Ukrainian researcher based in the UK, I’m not only researching the topics and themes relating to Russia’s aggression of Ukraine, I’m also relating to them and the country as my home. It lends a different perspective to the research, I think. “I have been working on upholding human rights in Ukraine for a number of years, and I focus on exploring the impact of conflict-related human rights violations. I am currently researching two topics: how the war and occupation have impacted the lives of children and their right to education, and the rights of civilians who are being detained by the occupying forces. “War leads to abuses on all sides. It goes beyond the obvious, well-documented disruptions such as destruction, air raids, power blackouts, and food and healthcare shortages. Indeed, by halting children’s education, Russia is also damaging the future generations of Ukraine. War leads to abuses on all sides. “After the war ends, we will need a new generation to rebuild the country, but due to Russia’s intentional disruption of the education system, Ukrainian children are missing out on basic education. Not only are they unable to access sufficient and safe education, which means they are struggling to develop the skills and knowledge expected of children at their age, but the trauma they have experienced — and will continue to suffer — means there’s a lot to be done to ensure that these children go on to live healthy, fulfilling lives. “My second project, which I am currently working on with colleagues from the Eastern Europe and Central Asia office, investigates Ukrainian civilians who have been detained for opposing the occupation. Many of them have gone missing without a trace, and have likely been locked up arbitrarily in inhumane conditions that amount to torture. “When carrying out research in the field, mornings are very early. You are lucky if you get to have breakfast. During our most recent trip to research the impact of the invasion on access to education, we would stop at a gas station to get fuel and some food on the way to conduct interviews. This means having a gas station hot dog and coffee for breakfast. This is usually the main food for the day, so you eat what’s there. We often don’t have time for lunch. “Once we’ve eaten, we will drive to the first location to conduct interviews. This can be difficult, as often there are air raids and sirens, which means we frequently have to pause our interviews to flee to a bomb shelter. “With the air raids going off all night, day to day I’m often very tired. However, as tired as I might be, when going into the interviews you know people are going through much worse. They are living in constant fear of attacks, and often don’t feel safe going outside, which means I have to consider conducting interviews in close proximity to a bomb shelter. Among all this, I’m constantly checking in with our security team and colleagues to let them know the team is safe. “I am aware of my position as a Ukrainian working at home among people who are enduring unimaginable amounts of suffering on a daily basis. I often feel guilty that I’m there for a short time, researching and gathering evidence and then leaving. “Sometimes, I’ll interview people in an area or region only to read the following week that Russian forces attacked that area. When this happens, you can get lost in worry. Are the people I spoke to okay? Should I call them? Calling from London, I feel worried about coming across as insensitive, but Ukraine is my home, and these are my fellow citizens, so I care a lot. “As a woman working in the field, there is often extra pressure to ensure I’m perceived well by whomever I am interviewing. I prepare for all eventualities. I think everything through carefully, from clothing choices to having enough supplies to last for the day. “I plan every step. It becomes easy to overthink each and every choice, but I can be speaking to so many people who work in different fields. There is a lot to consider. For example, it might be practical to dress in practical, utilitarian clothing, but you don’t want in any way your clothes to resemble a military uniform. Then, of course, you want to seem professional, but you don’t want to be perceived in a certain way, especially when crossing military check points. It’s a constant limbo of choices that I’m stuck in. “I also have to pack snacks, water, a first aid kit, a phone, chargers, voice recording devices and anything else that might be needed. This means that after a long day of interviewing, most evenings are spent working, writing up, completing admin tasks and packing and preparing for the next day. “The security implications of working in the field in an active war zone mean I report to security every morning and throughout the day, sharing all movements so that we can be kept as safe as possible. The security implications of working in the field in an active war zone means I report to security every morning and throughout the day, so we can be kept as safe as possible. “We essentially work from 7am to 7-pm in the field, working from the car as we go between locations. We conduct lots of phone calls from there: checking in with security, speaking to people to arrange interviews, etc. “We usually finish interviewing around 5pm. While driving back to where we are staying, which can sometimes take hours, we often find a place to have dinner. Thank goodness Ukraine has incredible food! “Of course, the trip is also fun. You get to learn a lot more about your colleagues, in circumstances that show the real person that you’re working with. You become close and this helps with managing the stress and tiredness. There is always something that happens during the day to make us laugh or smile among the suffering and sorrow we bear witness to. Such is the nature of the resilience, optimism and ferocity of Ukrainian people.”  Every year, our global community comes together to fight injustice and support people whose human rights are under threat.

Spyware is a type of malicious software. It interferes with a device’s normal operation to collect information without alerting the user and sends it to another unauthorised entity. Highly invasive spyware allows unlimited access to a device by default. It leaves little to no trace, so for the user it’s almost impossible to know what data was taken. It can target any connected device: phones, computers and other devices that connect to the internet. Spyware can infect a device when a user clicks on a malicious link or even without them doing anything. The infection methods include: The device is infected when the user clicks on a compromised link.

Surveillance operators want to compromise devices so they can access all the data stored there. While spyware tools have been used for a long time, the increase in encryption after the Edward Snowden revelations in 2013 has made private data more difficult to collect by other surveillance methods. This has created a bigger demand for spyware. Law enforcement, military and intelligence agencies are the top users and clients of spyware and surveillance companies. They may want to find out specific information like: Governments and companies say that these surveillance tools are only used to target ‘criminals and terrorists’. But in reality, human rights activists, journalists and many others across the world have been unlawfully targeted with spyware. The unlawful use of spyware violates many human rights, like the right to privacy, and the rights to freedom of expression, opinion, assembly and association. But spyware harms different people in different ways. Data can be weaponised and lead to more abuse, online and offline – especially for people who already face discrimination based on their identity. This abuse can take many forms, like blackmail, doxxing, cyber-stalking, harassment, and intimidation. Think again. Our research shows that activists and journalists who fear they are under surveillance will be less likely to speak out critically of their government or report on certain issues, for fear of being targeted and putting themselves, their sources and loved ones at risk. This has an impact on all of us – the right to protest, and a free press reporting on issues that shape our lives, are key building blocks of any rights-respecting society. It’s difficult to fully protect yourself from attacks, but here are some key essential digital security tips: When governments and companies attack the people who are defending our rights, then we’re all at risk.

0,Mohamed: “Migrant workers in Qatar should not be exploited and abused like I was”,AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2023/12/migrant-workers-in-qatar-should-not-be-exploited-and-abused-like-i-was/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? As Sri Lanka grappled with economic turmoil, Mohamed, 38, saw a chance to provide a better life for his family with the promise of a new job in Qatar. As he left behind his family, home and country, he never expected that the months to come would be filled with worry, grief and stress – and a longing to go back home. Here, he shares his story and lays bare the exploitation he faced as a migrant worker in Qatar, the year after the country hosted the 2022 FIFA World Cup… With the burgeoning petrol crisis and rising food costs in Sri Lanka, it was becoming difficult to support my family, even though I had a secure job. When I heard of a job opportunity in Qatar, I was hopeful I could do more for my family by working abroad and earning a better wage. I was told by the local recruitment agency in Sri Lanka, that I needed to pay 4 lakhs in Sri Lankan rupees (US$1,220) to register my job application. I sold my three-wheeler tuk-tuk to get the money, even though it was my only means of transport and making a living. I felt it was a sacrifice that needed to be made if I wanted to provide for me and my family. In early 2023, I left Sri Lanka, hopeful for a better future. But when I arrived in Qatar and saw my accommodation, any hope I had was shattered. Instead, a feeling of unease settled over me. I knew something wasn’t right. I’ve worked abroad before, but this was different. The accommodation was dirty and 10 of us were sharing a room. We were made to work 10-hour shifts at construction sites building houses. We weren’t given any kind of protection, not even a helmet. It was hard and intense hands-on labour, in excessive heat. Soon one month passed, and while I was expecting my paycheck, the company told us they would keep our first month’s salary. Instead, we would receive our wages from the second month on, they said. We were exhausted by the work and given just a small allowance each week for food and other basics. I couldn’t send money home. With no other source of income my mother and wife had to take loans from neighbours and pawn jewellery so they had enough money to survive.  This wasn’t what I had been promised in Sri Lanka. I was frustrated, but I had to keep working. I needed this job to support my family back home and I thought at least when my salary came it would provide relief to my family, so I didn’t complain and instead bore the stress that came with it. Then the second month came and passed too. When we asked for our salaries again, we were told we would receive our money next month. I couldn’t send money home, and with no other source of income my mother and wife had to take loans from neighbours and pawn jewellery so they had enough money to survive. They felt helpless with nowhere to turn to. They were barely able to get by. After three months with no pay, I was desperate and frustrated. Together with a few of my co-workers, we lodged a labour complaint against the company for withholding our salary. Some of my colleagues had not been paid for months. Usually, when a case is lodged, the company will be notified. During this time, we had stopped work in the hope of a positive outcome of our case. In return, the company stopped giving us our basic food allowance and kicked us out of the accommodation, while refusing to pay our salaries. Weeks passed and we would either have one meal a day or no meal at all. I was desperate and looked for any help I could get. I came across Amnesty International’s campaign on FIFA and Qatar’s treatment of migrant workers, I reached out and Amnesty International recommended us to Qatar’s National Human Rights Committee who helped us with shelter, while a local activist helped us with food. At one point, my colleagues and I walked all the way to the labour courts as we had no money. There were no pavements, so we walked on the highway under the blazing sun, only to be told they had not received our case. We remained hopeful that we would still hear from the courts, with a fair decision for the time and money we had lost. We were called back to the labour court and informed by an officer there that he would make sure we got our outstanding salaries and our Qatar ID, so we could change companies and keep working to support our family. I had already spent so much and had got into debt to come to Qatar, I couldn’t afford to go home so soon. We kept asking and asking, but he never made good on his promise to us. In the end, eight months after I arrived in Doha the company gave me just two months of salary. They wouldn’t give us our ID, so there was no other option but to accept a flight ticket back to Sri Lanka. The Qatari government doesn’t enforce the laws to protect people like us properly. Companies know that most migrant workers would rather go home and lose everything than remain without accommodation and food. If it wasn’t for the support of human rights organizations, such as Amnesty, we wouldn’t have survived as long as we did. I feel the labour court has ties to these companies, so there is no justice in our situation. There is no justice in our situation. Now I’m home, I’ve had to work as a daily labourer, doing odd jobs in my town until I find more stable work. If it’s a decent day’s work, I earn about LKR 1,500 (US$ 4.60) a day. I came back home to an even worse situation than before I left for Qatar. I feel I would have been better off if I had never left. I lost more than I gained by taking this job in Qatar. I want to be able to tell my story, so others don’t suffer a similar fate. Sadly, I am not the only one who has suffered. Migrant workers in Qatar should not be exploited and abused like I was.

The Americas is the world’s deadliest region for those defending land, territory and the environment. As companies and authorities continue to destroy and pollute the places Indigenous People call home, communities are riddled with health issues, while livelihoods are destroyed and environmentalists are criminalised for speaking out.  Three environmental defenders from across the region reveal why, despite the terrifying challenges they face, they’re fighting for a healthy environment for all… Colombia is one of the most dangerous countries in the world in which to defend land, territory and the environment. Yuly Velásquez, President of the Federation of Artisanal, Environmental and Tourist Fishermen of the Department of Santander (FEDEPESAN) – an environmental organization focused on protecting wetlands and rivers in Barrancabermeja, Colombia – has experienced violence first-hand. Last year, Yuly was the victim of an armed attack, after she was shot at, while assessing damage to her local environment, while other members of FEDEPESAN have experienced violence too. Here, Yuly shares the dangers of being a female environmental defender… “Everyone in Colombiadeserves the right to clean water. Yet, our rivers and waterways are heavily polluted because of oil and gas. People are suffering from gastrointestinal diseases, and often have constant diarrhoea and rashes – no one knows where these diseases are coming from, but it’s because we are drinking polluted water. “It’s having a huge impact on our livelihoods too. Where I live, we need pristine water to catch and sell good fish. But because of the pollution, our catch is declining, affecting us economically. It’s not the same now as it was 10 years ago: the catches are paltry. Nowadays we don’t find crowns, we don’t find crabs, we don’t find sea breams or catfish. “It’s a huge worry for us. It’s so sad that in Colombia—a country both rich and poor—many families go to bed without any food. It’s troubling to see so many dead fish all year round. That’s why I want to ensure those responsible for pollution are held accountable. But, it’s not easy. “As a female activist defending our waterways, I don’t have the security to freely carry out our fishing activities and protect our environment. It’s a dangerous place to be. I’ve been shot at in the past and my bodyguard was wounded. Yet, despite the threats and attacks, more women have joined our cause and we’ve learnt to stand with one another – many have even got their children involved. It really motivates me and fills me with pride to see so many people join our cause. Recently, another organization told me: ‘We are here to support you, you are not alone.’ Messages like that are a bright spot amongst adversity and shows that our message is taking hold. “While authorities still see the environment as a separate issue, we’re calling for companies that use fuel and oil not to dump them directly into the river, waterways or wetland. Instead, they must find a proper place to dispose of them so they do not show up downstream. Some people still drink water directly from the rivers with no basic treatment whatsoever. “Our dream is for communities across Colombia to be able to consume clean water – and it’s essential it reaches to all our settlements and communities, both urban and rural.  I really want our older generation to feel proud of our work – they were aware of the risks of defending our land, yet they did it anyway. I am determined to do the same.” In 2021, nine schoolgirls sued the Ecuadorean government, saying the use of flares by oil companies in the Amazon violated their constitutional rights to a healthy environment and to health. They won their case, but more than a year later, they’re still fighting to protect their community. Here, activist Donald Moncayo, executive coordinator of the Union of People Affected by Texaco and whose daughter led the complaint, reveals why…© UDAPTActivist Donald Moncayo is protecting his community  executive coordinator of the Union of People Affected by Texaco and whose daughter led the complaint, is sharing his story.  “From the moment oil was found and extracted in the Ecuadorian Amazon, gas flares were installed in various places, to separate oil, water and gas, causing huge environmental damage. “Although the courts were aware of the environmental damage, they did not know the harm the flares were causing to people’s health. Thanks to my daughter and her friends, in 2021, a court finally recognised the damage it causes to the residents and families who live near to the flares. Alongside the court case, we conducted research, revealing how the flares were releasing carbon dioxide and monoxide into our air, as well as polluting our water. Our research further revealed that 90 per cent of the cancer cases registered are close to the oil infrastructure – and the number of cases will only keep growing until they remove the flares – directly contradicting information gathered by the Ministry of Environment. “While the Provincial Court ordered companies to remove the gas flares closest to the population, the others won’t be removed until 2030, meaning the smog from the pollution will continue to travel for kilometres, damaging our health and environment. “I am determined to raise awareness of this issue and the environmental liabilities oil companies have left – it’s a risk I am taking, but it’s worth it. There is a way to mitigate this and operate in a cleaner, friendlier way – for the environment and the health of the people who live here. But that costs money. “I am calling for the gas lighters to be removed as quickly as possible, so our children can have a better quality of life. Growing up, I had to walk on a road covered in oil, bathe in the rivers full of oil, drink contaminated water and breathe air rife with the smell of burning gas. We are not victims – we are fighters and we all deserve the right to a healthy environment now – not in seven years!” Wet’suwet’en land defenders face continued surveillance and criminalization by the British Columbia (B.C.) provincial government and Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). At the source of the struggle is the construction of the Coastal GasLink (CGL) pipeline, which cuts the Wet’suwet’en territory into two. The pipeline has been opposed by all five Wet’suwet’en clans and their Chiefs have not consented to its construction according to their laws and customs. Determined to build the pipeline without delay, the pipeline company, and the B.C. provincial government and the RCMP have opted for violent responses, reminiscent of past colonial repression and trauma – putting peoples, lives and land at risk. Here, Dr. Karla Tait, a clinical psychologist and Director of Programming for the Unist’ot’en Healing Centre, shares her struggles… “I’m a mother, I have a nine-year-old daughter. She follows my clan, she is Unist’ot’en, and her children will be Unist’ot’en. I think that matrilineal way is imbued with so much wisdom, because mothers carry and nurture their children from conception, and bring them into this world. Who best to watch out for their interests, their longevity, and their good life, and the territory that will support them, than mothers? “It’s critical that my daughter grows up knowing how to survive on her territory. Knowing how to live off the land, knowing what healthy land looks like, what healthy waterways look like. Walking where her ancestors walked. Only by living on and knowing the land can she recognize when more advocacy and protections are needed. “It is essential to preserve the integrity of our land to provide for our future generations. “There’s so much empowerment that comes with knowing your food from its source, knowing how to prepare it and provide food for your family outside the larger Western capitalist system. “Our resistance to this project is our existence here. We have every right to be here and uphold our law and not provide our consent. I don’t think we can allow anyone to run us off our territory and erase who we are. In our day-to-day practices we have a spiritual connection to the land. Our survival as a people depends on that connection.  “I need to be here for the land to take back all this heavy colonial oppression that we live with. It’s a reciprocal thing: we’re fighting for the land, but the land is holding us up for that. And it’s doing that the same way it did for all the generations before me.”   It’s the only option we have to ensure Colombia lives free from violence Amnesty International’s latest report, Without their struggle, there is no future: Human rights defenders in the Americas speak out on the climate crisis, is out now. *This story was originally published on democraciaAbierta.

0,"Generation 2048: time to resist, disrupt and transform",AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2023/12/generation-2048-time-to-resist-disrupt-and-transform/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? 2023 marks the 75th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). Born from the ashes of World War II under the shadow of the very worst of humanity, the UDHR held out the promise of a global framework for justice and the recognition of ‘equal and inalienable rights’ for all.  Some question the legitimacy of the UDHR. After all, it was drafted by a minority of States at a time when many of the world’s population lived under colonialism. We cannot ignore this shortcoming, any more than we should neglect the critique that the modern human rights regime is a Western liberal project favouring civil and political rights over economic, social and cultural rights.   But while the UDHR was undoubtedly a victor’s project, its drafting ultimately could not be controlled by the powerful alone.  Smaller nations outmaneuvered the large, ensuring that the final text promised human rights for all without “distinction”.  The Egyptian delegate confirmed the “universality” of human rights and their applicability to persons subject to colonial rule or occupation.  Women delegates from India, Brazil and the Dominican Republic ensured that equal rights of men and women were affirmed.   We should celebrate the UDHR […] because of all those who have disrupted history with it. And, once in play, the UDHR took on a disruptive life of its own, feeding anti-colonial initiatives the world over and inspiring regional human rights instruments in Europe, the Americas and Africa.   The power of the UDHR ideals unleashed a force far beyond the control of those nations that had participated in its drafting. It did so because its roots ran far deeper, far wider than Paris, where it was adopted in 1948 by the General Assembly of the United Nations.  From Mesopotamia to Ancient Egypt, from the Persian to the Mauryan empires, in all religious traditions, in written texts or oral traditions, in ancient, pre-modern and modern eras – human history abounds with instances of people coming together to limit the use of power and assert their rights.     Let’s get the history of the UDHR right. Not by whitewashing it or by ignoring the raging double standards of its implementation. But by paying homage: to those who used its extraordinary disruptive power during struggles for liberation and equality the world over; to those who made the UDHR real and authentic, in their struggle against colonialism and for independence; against bigotry and for equality; against patriarchy and for gender justice; for a world of greater dignity for ‘all members of the human family’.   The UDHR legacy challenges us to go on the offensive. That is what the UDHR offers to us: both confidence and inspiration.  It is living proof that a global vision for human rights is possible, is doable, can be realised.  That is why we should celebrate the UDHR; why we don’t capitulate to critiques of human rights; not because of who wrote it into history, but because of all those who have disrupted history with it.  On this 75th anniversary, while the world grapples with record levels of conflict, socio-political polarization, growing inequality, and the existential threat of the climate crisis, dare we re-imagine ourselves as delivering a 2048 UDHR – a UDHR for the next century of rights – a UDHR drafted by the many, not by a privileged few?   We must build bold, visionary leadership, institutions and systems – that can protect our planet, for future generations, and from all that torments us.   Are we ready to be that 2048 generation?  The successor to those who, out of the ashes of a war-torn world, transformed history through the disruptive power of the UDHR?  Or will we instead be the generation that turned a blind eye to the oppression of others so long as our own power and influence was maintained?  The UDHR legacy challenges us to go on the offensive.  It demands that we resist the globalised, transnational and localised attacks against rights. But it also tells us this won’t be enough.  It asks of us too that we disrupt the building of world orders that reproduce historical privileges and injustices, violate rights and silence defenders; and that we transform global governance by re-imagining, innovating, leading.  We can, we must – build bold, visionary leadership, institutions and systems – that can protect our planet, for future generations, and from all that torments us.   Join us and together, let’s become this generation 2048 that brings to life a future where human rights are enjoyed by all, everywhere.   Bring to life a future where human rights are enjoyed by all, everywhere.   Every year, our global community comes together to fight injustice and support people whose human rights are under threat.

On 24 November 2022, at least 10 people died in an apartment fire in the city of Urumqi, northwest China. They were reportedly prevented from escaping due to strict covid-19 controls. The tragedy sparked an outpouring of anger and emotion. Across China, people took to the streets in numbers not seen for decades – many holding up blank sheets of paper to symbolize systematic censorship by the Chinese government – and the ‘White Paper’ protest movement quickly spread overseas. One year on, we hear from six people whose participation in those protests – in China and abroad – was a life-affirming experience*: The White Paper Movement (and the Sitong Bridge protest a month earlier) completely changed my life. Since October 2022, my fellow activists and I have put up solidarity posters, organized rallies and candlelight vigils – I even started an independent magazine. I did many things that I never imagined.  As an overseas Chinese, on one side is a foreign environment that I cannot fully integrate into, and on the other side is my homeland of China where nationalism is on the rise. I feel pessimistic and depressed in the gap between the two. I feel isolated and helpless under censorship, and I have to hide myself. But social movements have allowed me and others to see each other. We are no longer “disempowered” but can become “activists” and fight for human rights and justice. This in itself has become an identity that I am proud of. It also brought me the courage and motivation to continue participating in social change, despite the fear of retribution from the authorities. My civic consciousness awakened relatively late. Although I had been silently paying attention to social events before, it was not until the Fengxian chained woman incident and the Shanghai lockdown in 2022 that I began to move from speaking out to taking to the streets to protest. I participated in the protest on Urumqi Road in Shanghai on the night of 26 November. I never thought so many people in China would gather together to speak out for the victims of the lockdowns. It was also the first time that I witnessed the police’s treatment of the protesters at the scene. Atrocities. When I was arrested for taking part in the White Paper Movement, my life was completely changed. I was immersed in fear every day that I might not be able to go abroad in the future, but I was also determined to leave, and I did. An old man next to me raised his thumbs to us: “Good shout!” I burst into tears that had been silenced for a long time. After leaving China, I became more involved in social movements. I once dreamed of working in a big company after graduation, but now my artwork is related to politics, and I hope to work in a human rights organization in the future. On 27 November, 2022, I learned from social media that there was an event in support of the White Paper Movement at the Chinese Embassy in London that night. When I arrived, I found many candles lit to commemorate the compatriots who died in the Urumqi fire. I held an electronic candle, and many people around me also held homemade signs and posters, as well as pieces of white paper. There were speeches and slogans being shouted. From the passionate voices of the crowd, I could really feel their anger. I was also one of them. This was the first time I had seen so many people from within the Chinese community in the UK participating in a protest. The events I attended before were not attended by many people – sometimes, it was just me. But even if I am alone, I will not give up. What I know is that if we stop protesting, man-made disasters and humanitarian disasters will repeat themselves. I hope more people will realize this and keep protesting and working hard until freedom and democracy in China are truly realized. My hometown is one of the areas with the strictest surveillance and censorship in China, and it had the longest lockdown period during the pandemic. Communist Party slogans can be seen everywhere, and there are mandatory security checks at the entrance of every indoor public place. On 12 October 2022 my grandma, who rarely contacted me, sent me a WeChat message: “The epidemic here is very serious, and we are not allowed to go out. I don’t know when it will end!” On 13 October, I saw images of the Beijing Sitong Bridge protest on social media. Almost immediately, Chinese students from all over the world put up posters in solidarity. Although I had a small impulse to put up posters on my university campus, I actually didn’t know how to do it. After all, in China we have never learned how to express ourselves politically. Timidly, I printed five posters, and put Scotch tape and thumbtacks in my bag. But when I reached the main teaching building, I was overjoyed to find that there were already several posters about the Sitong Bridge incident, and I silently added mine. In this way, I met friends who put up posters on the same campus. A week later, we joined a protest in front of the Chinese Embassy. I wore a mask, and my hat covered my eyes and nose; I even stood behind one of my companions. When I thought that my family members thousands of miles away might get into trouble, I didn’t dare to shout out the slogans. Gradually I gained a little bit of courage and repeated the slogans in a low voice. An old man next to me raised his thumbs to us: “Good shout!” I burst into tears that had been silenced for a long time. There is no way of knowing whether anyone else has been arrested. China is like a black hole of information. After that, I became more actively involved in street protests and got to know precious “revolutionary sisters”. When my sisters and I walked onto the street, my body felt a release that I can’t describe. It was probably like taking the first breath of fresh air when you were about to be suffocated. Whether it is for your own demands or for the demands of people far away, perhaps those moments of shouting can define the feeling of being alive. In my dreams, I often go back to that time. When talking to many other people who were arrested for taking part in the White Paper protests, a word they often use is “trauma.” There is no doubt that I, too, live with this trauma. After the protests ended and I moved abroad, I collected many testimonies from participants of the White Paper Movement. This documentation is important. In modern China, the system has forced people time and again to forget their own history – all the disasters in the past, from the Great Leap Forward to Tiananmen. But I have always been confident in history and the future – these testimonies can make people adopt our narrative. As a “sensitive person”, living overseas is by no means an easy task. I have to worry about my own safety all the time, and the news that my family members in China were harassed by the police always affects my mood. There is no way of knowing whether anyone else has been arrested. China is like a black hole of information. On 26 and 27 November 2022, two busloads of people were stopped by police and disappeared into the Shanghai night. Where did those people go? Everything becomes a mystery. I always hope that one day in the future, at dawn, we can walk to the intersection of Urumqi Road again and recognize each other. I wonder how long it will take for that day to arrive. I can’t even remember the moment when the “White Paper Movement” broke out. The memory of that period is tense and fuzzy. It was the first time I put up a poster with political opinions, the first time I took to the streets, and the first time I faced a pair of eyes and said those code words that only existed privately between me and my friends. I remember the posters on the school bulletin board, and the rally in front of the Chinese Embassy in London on 27 November. It was such a strange feeling to see so many Chinese students at once. There were countless moments that I thought would be unforgettable, but now they have become a blur in my mind. At the time, I had no time to think about these things. Now, I am afraid of recalling the pain of those powerless moments. I am afraid of being constantly tormented by the guilt of “I did nothing.” I have friends who were violently injured by the police, detained for questioning and prevented from making contact. I have friends operating on campuses in China. I have friends taking to the streets of Beijing. In comparison, how do I dare say what I did was to participate in a “movement”? But I wrote this anyway. I believe this is because I comfort myself by being heard. Yes, I am heard and remembered, and that is when I feel most powerful. *Some activists’ names have been changed for security reasons Every year, our global community comes together to fight injustice and support people whose human rights are under threat.

As the realities of climate change become ever more real – wildfires, droughts, extreme temperatures, flooding – the calls for a complete phase out of fossil fuels are more urgent than ever.   But climate change isn’t the only downside to humanity’s addiction to coal, gas and oil. Burning fossil fuels violates our rights.    Extracting fossil fuels damages precious land and the livelihoods of people who live on that land. When people peacefully protest fossil fuels, they can face attacks, arrests or at worst, death.   “The problem is not simply fossil fuel emissions. It’s fossil fuels, period.” Antonio Guterres, UN Secretary General    Here are five things you need to know about the threat fossil fuels pose to our human rights.      Fossil fuels cause climate change which causes extreme destructive weather.  2023 saw record rainfall causing deadly flooding in Europe and China and record temperatures endured across Asia. There were enormous wildfires across swathes of North America and Europe. July 2023 was the hottest month ever recorded globally. Our oceans reached unprecedented high temperatures, bringing worrying shrinking of polar ice caps.    The fact that the use of fossil fuels is the primary cause of climate change has been settled science for decades. In turn we know that climate change makes destructive extreme weather much more likely and more harmful.    Climate change is already affecting the rights of millions of people, who may have lost their homes, be struggling to feed themselves and their families, have restricted access to clean water or be dealing with the health impact of extremely high temperatures. Many have lost their lives.    Climate change is affecting us all, however it disproportionately affects people who already face discrimination and marginalization. The people in countries which have contributed the least to climate change, are suffering the worst of its impacts.    In 2022 an important Loss and Damage Fund was agreed by the international community, to provide financial assistance and reparation to vulnerable countries and communities most impacted by the effects of climate change. But to be meaningful, the fund needs to be adequately funded and effectively and transparently operationalized with input and oversight by affected communities and civil society.    Fossil fuels pollution is bad for health.  The combustion of fossil fuels causes air pollution, which contributed to 1.2 million deaths in 2020 alone. Flaring and other processing activities also release toxic air pollutants that harm the health of workers and neighbouring communities.   As well as being used to produce energy, fossil fuels are also used to create plastics. The production of these plastics or petrochemicals can be incredibly harmful to the communities who live in the vicinity of factories. These communities are more likely to be racialized and low-income households. Petrochemical pollutants are known to increase risks to our health, including;   Fossil fuels also produce toxic waste, which if not processed properly can have disastrous impacts for people’s health. For example, the infamous dumping of fossil fuel related toxic waste in Cote d’Ivoire by Trafigura, which resulted in tens of thousands of people suffering from nausea, headaches, breathing difficulties, stinging eyes and burning skin.    Fossil fuels damage water, land and ecosystems.  When oil is extracted and transported it can result in irreversible spills. These spills damage nearby ecosystems, destroying the biodiversity and means of subsistence of fenceline communities and contaminating drinking water.   Coal mining and fracking both generate toxic waste that are known to contaminate water.   Every year, hundreds of oil spills irreversibly devastate the Niger Delta, caused by old and poorly maintained pipelines or criminal activity such as oil theft. Mining operators are failing to clean these spills, allowing them to continue their devastating impact on the fields, forests and fisheries that the majority of the people in the region depend on for their food and livelihoods.   The fossil fuel process takes up a lot of space, from wells, pipelines and roads and facilities for processing and waste management. In many cases, people are forcibly evicted from their homes so companies can extract and produce fossil fuels.    Indigenous peoples are particularly and disproportionately affected by these land grabs, since most of the remaining fossil fuels are situated on their land. In most cases, the livelihoods and cultural identity of these communities are uniquely connected with their land and natural environment. These cultural connections are threatened by the continued use and extraction of fossil fuels.  Fossil fuels companies spread misinformation.  Fossil fuel companies have access to huge budgets and wield significant influence. At COP27 there were 636 registered fossil fuel lobbyists, almost twice as many as Indigenous Peoples delegates. A report from the NGO InfluenceMap found that in the three years following the Paris Agreement, the five largest publicly traded fossil fuel corporations, which includes ExxonMobil, Shell, Chevron, BP and Total, invested over one billion dollars in lobbying and branding.   Fossil fuel companies use their power to influence the debate on climate change and fossil fuels internationally, pushing disinformation campaigns advancing false or misleading climate solutions. For example, these companies are lobbying for dangerous and unproven technologies, like carbon capture.   They also want to present fossil gas as a ‘clean’ bridge fuel to renewable energy, despite emerging evidence that the climate damage caused by fossil gas may be on par with coal.    The inequality in power and funding for corporate interests versus non-profit interests creates a power imbalance that favours fossil fuel companies. This undermines access to information, meaningful participation in multilateral discussions and negotiations by affected populations, including their ability to secure remedy for communities most harmed by fossil fuel’s impacts.   Human rights defenders who bravely oppose fossil fuels face repression and attacks.  States are failing to protect climate justice activists and environmental human rights defenders (HRDs) who oppose the use of fossil fuels. In some cases, governments even target these activists due to their work to phase out fossil fuels. especially when their activities clash with the state’s or corporations’ economic interests.   Climate and environmental defenders face continuous threats, attacks, smear campaigns, harassment and intimidation, which states too often fail to investigate, creating an environment of impunity. States also arrest and detain defenders who oppose fossil fuels. In some cases, fossil fuel companies target environmental HRDs through legal action to try and keep them quiet.    In Ecuador, members of the Amazonian Women collective received death threats, were attacked, had to leave their homes and were arrested because of their work to protect their ancestral land from the damages of fossil fuel extraction.    “They buried 50 explosives by night, and the people that did it knew that it was extremely dangerous. I had no other choice than to become a defender of human rights because petrol and oil companies violated the rights of my village and my people.” Patricia Gualinga    In South Africa, Fikile Ntshangase, a vocal opponent of a nearby open pit coal mine and its expanding operations, was shot six times and killed inside her home, allegedly by three hitmen known to police in the area.   Fossil fuels are bad for the climate and bad for human rights in general, which is why we need governments to commit to a fast, fair and full phase out of fossil fuels now.

Children and young people across Thailand are taking a risk by standing up for their rights and leading mass protests, despite a ruthless crackdown by the authorities. At least 286 children have been targeted with criminal and civil charges for their peaceful activism in the past two years. Despite the alarming repression, there’s a movement of determined young people who won’t give up.  Here, 18-year-old Anna reveals the battles she faces as a young human rights activist… Growing up, I struggled with Thailand’s strict education system. As a girl going to high school, my hair had to be a certain length. I wasn’t allowed to colour my hair and my socks had to be a certain height.  Living in a middle-class household, expectations were high. I studied seven days a week so I could attend a good school and go to university. Why couldn’t we have a fair election, I wondered? It was frustrating to adhere to so many rules and regulations from a young age and it made me want to change things. When I was 11, the news was flooded with activists calling for a democratic election as we were under a coup. Why couldn’t we have a fair election, I wondered? By the time I reached high school, a military government was in place and censorship was rife. Determined to make a difference, I joined a youth group. “Bad Students” started in 2020, as a place to talk about student rights and support kids experiencing difficulties. Now we are campaigning for change, creating a book on how to survive high school and calling for human rights education to be included in the school curriculum. If students are feeling helpless or frustrated with their situation at school, the group provides a safe space to share their feelings in person or online. From there we advise them on where to seek support. In cases involving violence, we contact the Ministry of Education or an NGO. Students deserve to enjoy human rights, rather than be at risk of abuse. There are few protections in place for children at school and it’s our responsibility to help them where we can. One student told us how their teacher cut their hair in front of everyone, embarrassing the child in front of their peers. For some, the consequences and shame of being unable to adhere to the school’s strict standards have been so traumatic that they have committed suicide. In total, three children have committed suicide this year because of how they’ve been treated within the school system.  These excessive and scary rules are down to the military, as well as the Thai school system. I understand the importance of a uniform, but it’s gone too far. If it’s cold, students aren’t allowed to wear a coat, while others can’t afford uniforms. And if students fail to meet these standards, punishments are harsh. In total, three children have committed suicide this year because of how they’ve been treated within the school system. It’s so sad. In protest, a 15-year-old girl decided to take a stand and dye her hair in honour of another student who committed suicide after being shamed and punished by their school for failing to conform with school regulations on haircut. She was expelled.  So many students have no hope as school is a scary place. I’ve been one of the lucky ones. As I was an activist and vocal about the situation, teachers just left me alone. And while some teachers fear our work, others have supported us, asking how they can be better teachers and encourage more children in class. Still, I often felt pressure to spend days and nights studying hard when I’m not pursuing my activism because I don’t want to let my family down. At the end of the day, I am just a teenager and it’s scary to live my life this way.  I’ve experienced many of these difficulties first-hand – I’ve been forced to cut my hair. I’ve been targeted by authorities and harassed by police for my work as an educational activist. I’ve been arrested, detained and placed on a watchlist, where authorities now follow me to school and wait outside my apartment. I’ve been deemed a security threat because I have dared use my voice. They even have a file on me and my family. At the end of the day, I am just a teenager and it’s scary to live my life this way. I try not let my fear get the better of me and I seek support from NGOs, such as Amnesty International, where possible. In fact, earlier this year, I was invited to Vienna and Geneva to meet other young human rights defenders and share what life is like in Thailand.  It was great to meet other student activists who also face risks every day, but it was challenging to share the problems I face as life is so different for us. It’s been difficult for my parents to accept my activism. They’re slowly starting to support me a little bit more, but I wouldn’t say they’re proud of me yet. I’ve chosen a different route. There’s nothing that can stop me standing up for my rights.   Standing up for your rights in Thailand is hard and there’s little protection in place for activists. I’ve heard stories of political activists who mysteriously disappeared when they were in exile. Then one day they were found to have been encased in concrete and drowned in a river – I don’t want to meet the same fate. Still, there’s nothing that can stop me standing up for my rights. Moving forward, the best hope for young people is a new government. It’s hard to keep up the fight when change is so slow, but I am determined to finish my law degree so I can work for a human rights organisation like Amnesty International – they have been pivotal in my work as a young human rights defender and I’d like to be able provide the same support to others one day.

0,Debt and the Right to Health: Closing Observations from Our Series,AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2023/10/debt-and-the-right-to-health-closing-observations-from-our-series/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? This blog series has offered an insight into the situation in four African countries where the level of public indebtedness is hampering States’ abilities to meet their legal obligations to fulfil their people’s right to health. As the series shows, there can be a range of causes for high levels of debt but regardless, the resulting debt service costs often restrict funding to healthcare. What is clear from the series, though, is that the global financial mechanisms in place for addressing unsustainable debt levels in developing countries are not fit for purpose. As we saw in the case of Zambia, the conditionalities attached to the loan agreement with the IMF are placing additional burdens on people’s incomes. Furthermore, even though the agreement is for a loan amount of USD 1.3 billion, the IMF only released USD 188 million once the review was approved. One of the hurdles to this has been the requirement  Zambia reach agreement with all official creditors concerning  debt treatment and restructuring. A deal to restructure USD 6.3 billion was  finally reached in June 2023 – 18 months after the country defaulted. Zambia is likely to have a 3-year grace period on debt repayments, with outstanding debt rescheduled over the next 20 years – continuing to limit the country’s long term  ability to fulfil obligations to provide quality healthcare, goods and services without discrimination. In Burundi, increasing internal and external pressures have weakened the government’s ability to provide adequate primary healthcare for the population. The situation is compounded by corruption and political uncertainty which threaten the stability of society and the economy. While there are positive developments such as prioritized social spending, improved tax administration and reform, Burundi is largely dependent on the easing of sanctions, increased donor support and debt relief to weather global crises, while addressing pressing socio-economic rights issues. In July 2023 the IMF approved a loan as part of an economic reform agenda. Time will tell if these conditions enhance or inhibit Burundi’s economy, and more importantly, the government’s resources and ability to address healthcare deficits. In Malawi, the government has been relatively proactive in reaching out to creditors and negotiating relief. The IMF has also supported the economy by providing USD 88.3 million to supplement food security resources. The loan is currently interest free and the country is still required to pay it back within 10 years. Given the history of budget support to Malawi, further funding from the IMF is conditional on economic reform. Debt is compounded by challenges of corruption, rapid inflation, high donor dependence, limited revenue-raising opportunities, exposure to climate shocks and poor spending implementation. This means Malawi still falls short in their constitutional promise of ensuring funds are not diverted from providing available, accessible, acceptable, and quality healthcare. In Uganda, the economy and citizens have been hit by the knock-on effects of global economic issues, the war in Ukraine and the Ebola outbreak in 2022. The rise in debt repayments and revisions to the budget, have meant health sector financing has suffered. In October 2023, the World Bank announced it would resume new funding to Uganda (halted in August 2023, after the Anti-Homosexuality Act was passed in May 2023). The World Bank has been a driver in financing health infrastructure in the country. A continued rise in debt, tax evasion and avoidance, and potential spillovers from the civil war in Sudan mean Uganda is unlikely to address primary healthcare needs in the short-term and fulfil its obligations to provide health services for all. In all cases investigated, governments were optimistic about their commitment to healthcare financing, despite poor track records on budget credibility and implementation. In many instances, spending performance and delivery are related to the strength of institutions, the effectiveness of systems and possibly even capacity. Whatever the issue, the blog series analysis confirms these countries have insufficient resources to address the levels of need in the healthcare sector – never mind other budget priorities. In this context debt financing is one of the only avenues for improving resource levels. The conditionality, interest rate and terms of these agreements, however, are not always in the long-term interest of the people. The diversity of creditors to African countries, lack of reform to the global financial architecture, and the case-by-case approach to debt treatment negotiations have undermined the development of a meaningful and comprehensive approach to Africa’s debt crisis. The HIPC initiative, MDRI, the Debt Service Suspension Initiative and now the Common Framework have only partly addressed the issue.

Reading the news can be really depressing. Sometimes there seems to be so much wrong in the world, the idea of changing it for the better feels impossible. But as Amnesty International’s Write for Rights campaign shows, you can make a big difference by doing something “little”.  Writing a letter, sending a tweet, signing a petition. Surely you can’t change the world with something so simple? Yes, you can! Since Write for Rights started in 2001, millions of people, just like you, have changed the lives of those whose human rights had been stripped from them. In fact, since 2001, more than 50 million actions have been taken, while over 100 people featured in our campaign have seen a positive outcome to their case!

Joanah Mamombe, Cecillia Chimbiri and Netsai Marova, from Zimbabwe, were arrested in 2020 after leading an anti-government protest. Following their arrest, they were beaten and sexually assaulted by the authorities. Their injuries were so horrific they were hospitalized.  While they were recovering, Joanah, Netsai and Cecillia were charged with criminal offences relating to the protest and later re-arrested and charged with faking their ordeal. While Netsai fled the country, Joanah and Cecillia’s case went to trial.  As part of Amnesty’s Write for Rights campaign 2022, our supporters took action for the trio, while Amnesty International Zimbabwe supported them throughout their trials. In July 2023, Joanah and Cecillia were finally acquitted. While reading the letters of support, Joanah said: “Thank you so much to our Amnesty International friends for writing all these letters. We are now beginning our journey to heal.” Bernardo Caal Xol, a Guatemalan teacher and environmental activist, worked tirelessly to defend communities affected by hydroelectric projects on the Cahabón river in northern Guatemala.

Initially unable to leave Burundi following his release, Germain was finally reunited with his family in Belgium in February 2022.  Supporters from around the world took more than 436,000 actions calling for Germain’s release. He told Amnesty International:  “Write for Rights really does have a positive impact. Their support has made me, Germain Rukuki, come out of prison even more committed to defending human rights.”  Write for Rights 2023 is nearly here!

0,A society behind bars: the effects of Algeria’s widespread crackdown on human rights,AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2023/09/a-society-behind-bars-the-effects-of-algerias-widespread-crackdown-on-human-rights/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? The Algerian authorities are leading a relentless crackdown on citizens for expressing any form of dissent. Be it participants in protest marches, journalists working for independent media, or people posting on social media, no-one in Algeria is safe from the claws of repression. Since the “Hirak” weekly protest movement broke out in 2019, first opposing a fifth mandate of then-President Abdelaziz Bouteflika and then evolving into a wider response to the lack of political freedom in Algeria, hundreds of people have been arbitrarily arrested and detained. The authorities targeted people they considered leaders of the protest movement and those reporting on it, but after the weekly protests were banned due to Covid restrictions, the authorities expanded their crackdown. Young and old; urban and rural; activists and school children, no matter the gender, the Algerian authorities are going after anyone exercising their right to freedom of expression, assembly or association in a way deemed threatening to the government. The authorities have used various means to broaden their repression, including making repeated arbitrary arrests; imposing heavy fines; pressuring dissidents’ family members for information on their whereabouts; and in at least one case, abducting a fleeing activist with refugee status and forcibly returning him back to Algeria to face trial on bogus charges. Authorities have also employed the tactic of pre-trial detention beyond the legal limit, have meted out lengthy prison sentences, and have subjected detainees to torture and other ill-treatment. According to local watchdog groups, over 200 people remain detained in Algerian prisons for expressing dissent, often sentenced under problematic articles in the Penal Code such as “harming” the national security, “undermining national unity”, “offending” public officials, “incitement” to unarmed gathering, spreading fake news, and terrorism. Amnesty International interviewed former detainees as well as the families and lawyers of those who remain behind bars. The individual stories highlighted here underscore the suffering people have endured at the hands of the Algerian authorities. In documenting these experiences, Amnesty International urges support in demanding the Algerian authorities grant the urgent and unconditional release of those arbitrarily detained, halt the harassment of opponents and perceived critics outside prison, and ultimately reform the legislation that enables serious violations of people’s rights to freedom of expression, assembly and association. Authorities have detained people just for peacefully expressing their opinions, including journalists and citizens penalised for social media posts. Over the past two years, the Algerian authorities have prosecuted, arrested, or detained at least 12 journalists and media workers. Algerian authorities are engaged in an unrelenting assault on independent media and all critical voices, typically using bogus charges such as “spreading fake news” and “offending” public officials. This is in clear contrast to Algeria’s commitments under Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil Political Rights as well as Algeria’s constitution, which protects the rights to freedom of expression and freedom of the press. Authorities have also imprisoned people for protesting, many were part of the Hirak demonstrations, which erupted in February 2019 calling for political reform. During the Hirak protests, Algerian authorities arbitrarily arrested, and unlawfully prosecuted and detained political and civil society activists and journalists based on vaguely worded Penal Code provisions such as “harming the security of the state” and “armed and unarmed gathering”, which have both been misused against peaceful protesters. In May 2021, authorities used Law No. 91-19 on public meetings and demonstrations to halt the Hirak protests by requesting prior declaration for every protest. Algerian authorities are cracking down on members of associations or groups deemed as in opposition of the government, as well as the groups themselves. People have been detained for their membership to or links with associations, many of them prosecuted on bogus charges of terrorism. In 2021, the authorities shut down the well-known civil society organization, Youth Action Rally (Rassemblement Actions Jeunesse), on accusations of carrying out activities that do not match its status. In 2022, the authorities suspended an opposition party, forcing it to cease all activities and close its premises, and threatened two other parties with a similar fate, claiming that the parties had breached the law by organizing “unauthorized gatherings”.  Terrorism charges used to shut down groups and prosecute their members The Algerian authorities have been increasingly using vaguely worded anti-terrorism charges to prosecute people for being members of groups deemed as oppositional. In 2021, the authorities labelled the political organization Rachad and the political group Movement for the Self-Determination of Kabylie (MAK), as “terrorist entities”. In the same year, the Penal Code was amended to expand the definition of terrorism to include “attempting to gain power or change the system of governance by unconstitutional means”. The people you see above are just a few of the hundreds of people who have been punished merely for exercising their rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly, and association. As of August 2023, there remained dozens of activists, journalists, and state critics in Algerian prisons. Amnesty International calls on the Algerian authorities to: Immediately release all those arbitrarily detained and stop the criminal investigations of people simply for peacefully exercising their human rights including freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly. Repeal Law No. 12-06 on Associations and elaborate a new law in line with Algeria’s Constitution and its international obligation to respect and ensure freedom of association Amend all provisions that criminalizes peaceful association and assembly including Articles 79, 95 Bis, 97, 98 and 100 of the Penal Code. Amend Articles 15, 17, 19, 23 of Law No. 91-19 on Public meetings and Demonstrations to bring it in line with international human rights law. Amend or repeal all provisions which criminalize free expression, including Penal Code Articles 74, 75, 96, 144, 144 Bis, 146, 196 bis and 290 bis.

0,Building resilience: Public debt management and health financing in Uganda,AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2023/09/building-resilience-public-debt-management-and-health-financing-in-ugand/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? Although Uganda inherited a significant debt from its colonial government in 1962, the country’s debt increased rapidly between 1966 and 1986. During this period, massive corruption, political instability and conflict undermined economic growth and reduced tax collection. Furthermore, the British colonial authorities had underdeveloped Uganda’s manufacturing sector making Uganda over-reliant on imports and reducing the viability of its economy and tax collection. A sharp decline in coffee prices in the 1980’s and 1990’s coupled with the heavy investment in rebuilding a war-torn economy, further worsened Uganda’s debt between 1986 and 2006. In fact, by 1992, Uganda’s debt to GDP ratio had grown to 109%, from 31% in 1987. The rapid increase in Uganda’s debt led to loan rescheduling programmes by the Paris Club in 1989 and 1992, but this was too little too late. In 2006 the country received 100% debt cancellation through the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative, but this only reduced the country’s debt by 20% given the multiplicity of lenders. Despite economic growth, Uganda continues to experience rising debt to GDP ratios – reaching 57.9% of GDP in 2022, from 45.1% in 2019. Uganda received several credit facilities from China, the World Bank and IMF including USD 1 Billion for post-COVID recovery in 2021. The latest USD 240 million, received in January 2023, was the final payment under the 2021 loan. Uganda, however, still experiences massive corruption, which undermines fiscal discipline. Uganda is the second highest recipient of Chinese loans among East African countries, accounting for 33.9% of all Chinese loans in the region between 2015 and 2020. The IMF and World Bank have often cited increasing transparency, accountability and governance reforms as means of bolstering efficient public expenditure and debt management. Uganda has been ranked by the IMF and World Bank as having a moderate risk of debt distress. The rapid increase in debt levels, however, threatens to move into debt distress. In August 2023, the World Bank announced it would halt new lending to Uganda as the anti-LGBTQ law, enacted in May 2023, is against the bank’s values. Uganda has had to revise its budget based on the change in availability of financing. Other institutions, civic groups and states have also threatened to halt aid and loans to the country, stating at this stage that projects would be funded on a selective basis. Communicable diseases, including malaria, HIV, and tuberculosis, account for up to 50% of mortality and morbidity in Uganda. Non-communicable diseases account for 30% of deaths. Recurrent Ebola outbreaks as well as COVID-19 have also placed strain on Uganda’s health budget. Uganda’s population is estimated to be 47 million. According to the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), Uganda has a maternal mortality rate of 438 per 100,000 live births, and an under-5 years child mortality rate of 90 per 1000 live births. Uganda also records one of the highest levels of malnutrition in Africa ( 29% of children considered stunted). Through World Bank support, Uganda has engaged in health system strengthening. Resource inadequacy, characterized by limited budget allocations, tax evasion and rising debt continue to undermine progress. For instance, approximately 12% of tax revenue is lost through evasion, while debt service costs account for 30% of tax revenue. This limits capacity to invest in public goods and services, with resources diverted to debt interest and repayments. Uganda also loses potential revenue through double taxation agreements, tax incentives and tax exemptions. Exemptions alone averaged USD 14.8 billion more than the primary healthcare budget in 2023/2024. Oxfam estimates Uganda will forego 6% of all expected tax revenue (2% of the health budget) due to exemptions on dividends. This is only for a single oil exploration area by Total Energies. 64.4% of Uganda’s revenue is from indirect taxes – mostly taxes on consumption and applying to everyone. This disproportionately affects the poor, with a higher proportion of their income spent on goods such as food.  Uganda is constitutionally obligated by paragraph IX and XX of its Constitution to provide health services for all. Paragraph IX in Article 8 of the UN Declaration on the Right to Development, the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights (ratified 1986), and the UN International Covenant on Social, Economic and Cultural Rights (ratified 1987) also place obligations on the state. The realization of this right, however, has been stunted by debt, and a result of insufficient resources.   According to the Uganda Insurance Regulatory Authority (UIRA), less than 1% of Ugandans have private health insurance. The state is currently establishing the National Health Insurance Scheme to address this.  In the meantime, 41% of health expenditure is out of the pockets of citizens. High levels of poverty, coupled with 10% inflation, have squeezed incomes, leaving households unable to buy food and other basic goods, let alone spend on healthcare. Global challenges like the war in Ukraine, COVID-19 and climate change continue to reduce tax collection, and increase spending needs, especially in relation to climate adaption. The resultant underfunding of public health has forced more than 24 million people to access private facilities, which are out of reach of the poorest and most vulnerable. This underlines the need for greater efforts and resources invested in expanding the reach and quality of universal health coverage (UHC). In 2022/2023, Uganda’s total budget increased by 47%, however, the health budget only increased by 0.7%. Despite the increase, at 7.7% of total expenditure, it still falls short of the 15% recommended by the Abuja Declaration. Over 50% of health funding comes from donors. Individuals and private actors also play a role in health provision. During COVID-19, donor funding peaked at 66% of the health budget, but continued reliance on donors is generally unsustainable and unpredictable.   In view of the above, Uganda should urgently and effectively implement its health financing strategy which acts as a blueprint for resource mobilization in the sector. Uganda must also recommit itself to timely, adequate, quality, accessible and acceptable health services for all – in line with its constitutional and international human rights law obligations and the Abuja Declaration. This involves committing significantly more resources to revamping health infrastructure, strengthening medical and pharmaceutical supplies, enhancing the provision of UHC (including primary healthcare), broadening access to affordable health insurance, and improving its disease surveillance systems. To address the crowding out of health funding, creditors need to work with Uganda to provide debt relief and restructuring and redirect resources back towards health. Enhanced transparency and accountability in resource management, fast-tracked tax reforms around indirect taxes, exemptions, tax evasion and avoidance, as well as tackling corruption will further bolster the available pool of resources for investment in health.  Every year, our global community comes together to fight injustice and support people whose human rights are under threat.

Holiday websites describe an area that boasts finely grained sand, remote and deserted lagoons and mouth-watering meals under beautiful African skies. And all of this is true of Sanyang – or was, until the arrival of big commercial fishing vessels off the coast and a fishmeal and fish oil factory on the beach.   For the local population, who vigorously assert that they were not consulted about the impact of these changes, the place has become anything but a paradise. Local people in Sanyang have gotten accustomed to the smell of rotten fish and smoke from the fishmeal factory. Mohammed, an environmental activist, told Amnesty International that the smell and the smoke is inescapable, seeping deep into people’s skin and homes. It is also a cloud hanging over their uncertain future.  Mohammed described his frustration with these words: “The smell just makes you angry. Thinking that we have been fighting for this for more than five years and nothing is happening. We are very very angry”.    Fishmeal and fish oil factories transform pelagic fish into fish oil or a powder called fishmeal, which is then used to feed farm animals and other fish, like salmon, in the aquaculture industry, usually in Europe, Asia and the Americas. It takes about 4.5kg of fish to make 1kg of fishmeal. Fish oil is also used in the form of pills as a food supplement. The fishmeal factory in Sanyang belongs to the Nessim Fishing and Fish Processing Co. Ltd, a Mauritanian-owned company, the last of the three such factories to be opened in Gambia.  In recent years, big foreign trawlers and the fishmeal and fish oil factories have been draining the Gambian coast of fish at a frenetic pace. Gambia exports almost 20,000 tonnes of fish annually through the activities of fishmeal factories, foreign industrial vessels and fish processors. Adding to that, the country, together with Mauritania, Senegal, Guinea Bissau, Guinea and Sierra Leone, lose about US$2.3 billion annually to illegal fishing.  The environmental footprint of big trawlers and the fishmeal factory is crushing. But the impact of this activity goes beyond overfishing, the destruction of ecosystems and sea pollution. The exploitation of fish stocks by larger boats is negatively affecting the livelihoods of artisanal fisherfolk.   The people of Sanyang acutely understand that the situation is harmful to them and their environment and that is not sustainable. At some point the factories and trawlers will move on, taking their profits with them and leaving local people with a devastated environment and economy and little future – and all that it could bring with it in terms of human misery and conflict.  Mohammed insists: “This is destroying ecotourism and employment, and it is pushing the youth to take the back door [irregular migration]. Now the local fishermen, instead of building their boats for fishing, they build them to sell tickets for the youth to migrate. Just recently, 150 of our youth left for Spain. It is a new business because fishing is not good anymore.”     According to Mohammed, community members have mobilized and knocked on all official doors to decry their situation to the authorities, to no avail. The failure of the authorities to take action to protect local communities and their rights to a decent environment and livelihoods is a source of deep frustration which is turning to outright anger.   Mohammed’s fears that, unless the government takes action to defend human and environmental rights, the future will be bleak for local people: “In five years’ time I foresee that, with the same government, these companies will still be here. Gambians will be hungrier, weaker, and this will bring more social and political instability”.  In March 2021, when a young Gambian man was killed by a man working on one of the boats hired by the fishmeal factory, young people in the community took part in a protest that spilled over into violence. Some 5,616 fishing nets, 10 fishing boats and 15 boat engines belonging to Senegalese fisherfolk were burned. The fishmeal factory was also partially burned down. Following these incidents, 50 youths from the community were arrested, some of them arbitrarily; 22 were initially charged in Brikama magistrates court with criminal offences. The charges were dropped by the magistrates’ court, but 13 men were then charged again, and their cases remain pending before the High Court.  Environmental degradation in Sanyang has resulted in misery for local people and people denied respect, rights and a sustainable future will express their frustration in many ways, including violence and conflict, when no other avenues are open to them. It is crucial that the Gambian authorities listen to what is happening and take steps to restore those rights, respect and futures for the people of Sanyang.  * A pseudonym has been used to protect the interviewee’s security and privacy.  The members of the communities affected by the overexploitation of the seas through the activities of Nessim Fishmeal Factory and foreign industrial trawlers are sharing their stories with us.

It is due to the fishmeal factory coming and having these big boats coming to fish, this has reduced small boats work. Because of the factory, they have these big boats here, but the Gambia government has a contract with this company to fish in our waters anytime.   When Amnesty International visited Sanyang in the West Coast Region of Gambia in March 2022, the contrast between the glorious landscape prized by tourists and the chain of dozens of men running back and forth endlessly while carrying hundreds of baskets loaded with fish on their heads, was shocking. In the meantime, artisanal fisherfolk were sitting on the beach mending their nets and drinking tea, as they had done for as long as anyone can remember.   Around them, there was a chain of dozens of men who were running back and forth endlessly, carrying hundreds of baskets loaded with fish on their heads. The pace was relentless, driven by the fact that the men are paid by the basket, so, speed is key. In the frenzy, some fish would fall to the ground and women on the beach, without skipping a beat, would pick them up and put them in their bags so they could sell them later at the market and get some money to support their families.   Even children took part in this ritual. They knew the rule: anything that fell on the sand was up for grabs. With their plastic bags, they picked up all the fish that fell from the baskets on the heads of the carriers or when the latter were loading the lorries which were waiting to be fully loaded before taking the fish to the fishmeal factory.    It was already midday and an increasing number of people had rushed to the beach to unload more fish from returning pirogues (canoes). The factory supervisor, who was on the beach overseeing the whole operation, said that they had only loaded 2 tonnes of fish that day. The back and forth to the factory by the carriers was incessant. Yet, he was disappointed, saying this was not a good day and that he hoped the other pirogues would bring more fish. It takes about 4.5kg of fish to make 1kg of fishmeal.   Seeing the number of fish caught – even on what was considered a bad day – was staggering. It was a never-ending ballet on the shore. But one that holds a stark warning – this level of exploitation may be very profitable to the fishmeal factories waiting to receive the fish, but it is agonizingly clear that it is not sustainable for the environment and local communities.   The local people in Sanyang know this only too well. They know that, in the long term, this exploitation of their coastal waters by the big foreign trawlers and the fishmeal factories is not sustainable at all. The faces of the people Amnesty International interviewed and their stories conveyed deep concern about the larger impact all this will have on their community – the increased prices of staple foods, the rise in unemployment among people who live from traditional/artisanal fishing and the growing food insecurity in a population for whom fish is an essential source of protein. According to the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization, between 2015 and 2020, the number of people affected by food insecurity increased in Gambia from 5% to 8%.  The artisanal fishermen sitting on the beach told Amnesty International that it was getting more and more difficult for them to find fish. The reasons for this were on full display – the scale and might of the international fishing industry. Local fishermen blamed the huge trawlers from China and Europe and pirogues working for the fishmeal factory for emptying their sea by removing tonnes and tonnes of fish – fish that is either directly exported, to Europe and other countries or turned into fish meal powder by three factories in Gambia that is used as feed for pig farms or salmon in foreign aquaculture farms. The factory impacting the people in Sanyang belongs to the Nessim Fishing and Fish Processing Co. Ltd, a Mauritanian-owned company; it was the last of the three factories to be opened in Gambia.   The devastation of communities and destruction of their way of life should be something that the Gambian government takes urgent action to address. Yet so far, it has failed to protect the human rights of its people in the face of an industry that is pouring waste to the delicate ecological balance of the area on which these communities rely.   * A pseudonym has been used to protect the interviewee’s security and privacy.  Listening to the voices of Sanyang and the stories of suffering from members of the community, it is hard to understand why the Gambian authorities are failing to act to defend the human rights of the people affected by the fishmeal factory and foreign trawlers. Clearly the voices of those championing the benefits of profits are louder and stronger – but the profits are not reaching the people paying the price for mass exploitation of Gambia’s coastal waters.  No matter who shouts loudest, the Gambian authorities have responsibilities that they must fulfil – including ensuring the rights of the population to food, work, health and a safe environment.   The Gambian government has a duty to protect these rights and pass legislation requiring companies to conduct human rights due diligence in their operations and supply chains and ensure proper monitoring of Gambia’s waters. It also has an obligation to ensure transparency and allow easy public access to information about fishmeal factories and foreign trawlers and investigate the possible detrimental impact of their operations.  The Nessim fishmeal factory must be transparent about its activities, regularly consult with the community and follow the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, including by putting in place an ongoing and proactive human rights due diligence process to identify, prevent, mitigate and address the factory’s impact on human rights. Given the potential high economic and environmental impact of its activities, it must phase out the use of fish that according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) are already overexploited, such as sardinella and bonga fish.   Companies in the supply chain of fishmeal factories also have a role to play. They need to conduct supply chain due diligence and publicly disclose their due diligence policies and practices, in accordance with international standards, and take action, in cooperation with other relevant actors, to mitigate or remediate any harm caused.   Responsibilities for the situation also lie further afield. The international community, including countries that have signed fishing agreements with Gambia, need to regulate the aquaculture industry to limit the use of fishmeal and fish oil made from already overexploited species and increase transparency regarding their supply chain. They cannot carry on closing their eyes and ears because the sights and smells of Sanyang are far from them – out of sight must not mean out of mind.   Join Amnesty International members and supporters in their campaign to protect Gambia’s coastal waters, marine resources and communities. Act now by emailing the President of Gambia, Adama Barrow, to demand that he ensures the implementation of Amnesty International’s recommendations.  * A pseudonym has been used to protect the interviewee’s security and privacy.

0,Families of the disappeared in the Middle East wait more than a million years collectively for their loved ones,AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2023/08/families-of-the-disappeared-in-the-middle-east-wait-more-than-a-million-years-collectively-for-their-loved-ones/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? Across the Middle East, both state authorities and non-state actors, such as armed opposition groups, abduct and disappear people as a way to crush dissent, cement their power, and spread terror within societies, often with total impunity. Human rights defenders, peaceful protesters, journalists, and political dissidents are often specifically targeted. Families and loved ones of the disappeared are left in limbo and experience constant mental anguish for many years and, sometimes, even decades. Most often, it is women who lead the struggle for truth, justice, and reparation, putting themselves at risk of intimidation, persecution and violence. And it is women who are left to shoulder the financial burden of providing for their families and caring for them, often with little to no state support and while facing oppressive patriarchal norms. They can neither organize a dignified burial nor properly grieve, and they spend their lives campaigning for the authorities to reveal the fate and whereabouts of their relatives. While the governments of most those states have not investigated disappearances nor provided accurate numbers of those missing or disappeared, family associations, human rights organizations and UN bodies have published estimates for the number of people abducted and disappeared in each country. In Iraq, the numbers range between 250,000 to one million disappeared. In Lebanon, the official figure is 17,415. In Syria, human rights organizations estimate the number to be over 100,000. In Yemen, human rights organizations have documented 1,547 cases of disappearance. When these numbers are multiplied by a conservative estimate of how many years these individuals have been missing, a tragic picture emerges of the agonising number of years families have spent waiting for answers – more than a million years. In the absence of effective state action, families of the disappeared have united under victim and family associations to demand their rights – often at great costs and personal risks. The right to truth for individuals and societies is recognized in international law and in the context of enforced disappearances, meaning “the right to know about the progress and results of an investigation, the fate or the whereabouts of the disappeared persons, and the circumstances of the disappearances, and the identity of the perpetrator(s)”. To commemorate the International Day of the Victims of Enforced Disappeared, Amnesty International is sharing the stories of extraordinary sacrifice and persistence by the families of the disappeared and by human rights organizations in each of these countries. The quest for truth, justice and reparation looks different for the families in each country, but what unites them is their shared struggle and their vision for a more free, safe, and cohesive society.  Share these stories in solidarity with the families of the disappeared and demand that meaningful action be taken to reveal the fate and whereabouts of their loved ones. Families of the disappeared in the middle east wait more than a million years collectively for their loved ones.  Iraq has one of the highest numbers of disappearances in the world, with people abducted and forcibly disappeared during the Ba’ath era (1968 – 2003), the US-led invasion and occupation of Iraq (2003-2011), the years of sectarian violence (2006-2008), the conflict with the armed group self-identified as the Islamic State (IS) (2013-2017), and the crackdown against protestors during the nationwide anti-government protests in 2019 and its aftermath. Despite Iraq’s ratification of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances, consecutive Iraqi governments have repeatedly failed to take meaningful steps to investigate disappearances, reveal the fate and whereabouts of those missing, or hold accountable those suspected of criminal responsibility. Crucially, the Iraqi authorities have still not recognized enforced disappearance as an autonomous crime in national legislation, and there have been no prosecutions for those suspected of criminal responsibility for enforced disappearance.   In April 2022, families of the disappeared launched the #DeadorAliveWeWantThem campaign to demand answers regarding the fate and whereabouts of their loved ones who were disappeared during the conflict with the Islamic State. The campaign was supported by Al Haq Foundation for Human Rights, which is helping families organize themselves nationwide and unify their demands across their locations, their backgrounds and the circumstances under which their loves ones went missing. On 15 August 2023, in the lead up to the International Day for the Victims of Enforced Disappearances, Iraqi families of the disappeared, survivors of enforced disappearances and human rights organizations came together in nationwide protests demanding truth and justice for abductions and enforced disappearances. According to the UN Committee on Enforced Disappearances, Iraq has an estimated 250,000 to 1 million missing persons since 1968, making it one of the countries with the highest number of missing persons worldwide. Every year, on 13 April – the anniversary of the start of the Lebanese Civil War – the families of the missing and disappeared gather to mark the beginning of Lebanon’s civil war and repeat the mantra, “Let it be remembered, not repeated.” Thousands of individuals went missing or were disappeared during Lebanon’s 15-year civil war (1975 – 1990). Enforced disappearances continued to be committed after the end of the war in 1990, but on a smaller scale. Key laws and agreements passed following the civil war, including the Amnesty Law 84/91 in 1991 and Ta’ef Agreement in 1989 which ended the civil war, are silent about the fate and rights of those disappeared or missing. In 1982, families of the missing joined forces to establish the Committee of the Families of the Kidnapped and Missing in Lebanon, unifying themselves and demanding that the authorities identify the fate and whereabouts of their loved ones and return their remains for burial. After years of action, including weekly sit-ins in front of the Council of Ministers and Parliament, letters to the President, and campaigns in the media, the Committee succeeded in pressuring the Lebanese authorities to take their first step in acknowledging the widespread enforced disappearances which took place during the civil war. The Lebanese parliament passed Law No.105 in November 2018 and established the National Commission for the Missing and Forcibly Disappeared with a mandate to investigate individual cases, locate and exhume mass graves and enable a tracing process. Although the passage of the law was a huge milestone for the families, the law fails to criminalize enforced disappearance and provides no avenue for holding those suspected of enforced disappearance accountable. Until today, the government has failed to provide a physical office for its operations. Moreover, over the past three years members have resigned and the government has failed to appoint replacements. Following the Lebanese civil war which took place between 1975 to 1990, a police report issued in 1991 recorded 17,415 cases of disappearances during the armed conflict. Until today, the families of the missing cannot confirm if their loved ones are dead or alive. The Syrian government has forcibly disappeared tens of thousands of its actual or perceived opponents, including political activists, protestors, human rights defenders, journalists, lawyers, doctors, and humanitarian aid workers. While enforced disappearances pre-dated the conflict that began in 2011, the Syrian government ramped up disappearances as a tool of punishment and intimidation since then. The wave of enforced disappearances carried out by the Syrian government since 2011 has been committed as part of a widespread as well as systematic attack against the civilian population and, therefore, amounts to a crime against humanity. Thousands have also gone missing after being detained by armed opposition groups and the so-called Islamic State (IS). Since 2011, the families of the disappeared and survivors have been leading global advocacy efforts to realize their right to know the fate and whereabouts of their loved ones. They have led protests across many countries and lobbied governments for answers about their loved ones, meticulously documenting and collecting evidence of the crimes committed in the context of the Syrian conflict. Given the Syrian government’s role in orchestrating the campaign of enforced disappearances, there has been total impunity for these crimes in Syria. The families have therefore resorted to international justice mechanisms. Although the UN Security Council has been so far unable to refer the situation in Syria to the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, due to Russian and Chinese vetoes, in December 2016, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution establishing an international, impartial and independent investigative mechanism (IIIM) with a mandate to compile evidence of atrocity crimes, but with no designated venue for prosecution. However, the IIIM has been collaborating with several jurisdictions in Europe, including in Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands and France, who have exercised universal jurisdiction, allowing their courts to prosecute grave international crimes regardless of where they were committed. In a momentous victory for the families, on 29 June 2023, the UN General Assembly voted to establish an international institution dedicated to clarifying the fate and whereabouts of those missing and disappeared since the start of the armed conflict in Syria. The proposed entity, to be set up in the coming months under the auspices of the UN, will allow for more systematic and coordinated efforts to determine the fate of more than 100,000 missing persons. Moreover, it will provide much-needed support to victims, survivors and their families. Since 2011, tens of thousands of individuals have vanished without a trace after being arrested by the Syrian government. According to reporting by Syrian human rights organizations, 100,000 are reported missing or have been disappeared at the hands of the Syrian government and armed opposition groups. All parties to the eight-year-long armed conflict in Yemen continue to commit crimes under international law and human rights violations with impunity, including enforced disappearances and abductions. Men and women have been disappeared for their political and religious beliefs and journalists, humanitarian aid workers, and human rights defenders have often been a target. Survivors of enforced disappearance and abduction have detailed how they were held incommunicado, and subjected to torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. In Yemen, the Abductees’ Mothers Association, a civil society organization formed by the mothers, wives, and female relatives of those forcibly disappeared, have been campaigning for years for their loved ones and documenting cases of enforced disappearances. The Abductees’ Mothers rallied outside detention centres, protested across the country and kept records of people detained and forcibly disappeared in the country. The families of the disappeared in Yemen are fighting for justice at great personal risk. Yemeni families are campaigning for justice, truth and reparation in the absence of a domestic law criminalizing enforced disappearance and repeated failures by the international community to set up an independent, international and criminally focused investigative mechanism to gather and preserve evidence of crimes under international law and serious human rights abuses and violations in Yemen. In October 2021, the UN Human Rights Council failed to renew the mandate of the Group of Eminent Experts, further dampening efforts to hold those suspected of criminal responsibility accountable. Amnesty International and other human rights organizations have documented numerous cases of enforced disappearance against civilians by all parties to the conflict. Mwatana for Human Rights, a Yemeni civil society organization based in Sana’a, has documented 1,547 cases of enforced disappearance and abduction since 2015.

The clouds light up orange, pink and then slowly darken. The heavy breath of traffic rises above the streets as it flows past like a tired beast. Birds begin to flit towards the refuge of the trees, and lights turn on in houses as people return home. Home. They warn you not to make homes out of people. But aren’t people what turn a house into a home? I used to wait for my father to come home every day. My sisters and I would be busy with different activities, but at 6pm we would all gather in the living room, waiting to hear the sound of his car pulling up in the driveway. Even our white-and-ginger cat, apparently dozing on his pillow, would keep his ears alert for the same sound. Every night, he would come home with a longing to be with his family. Every night, we would race each other to the door. He would hug us one by one, enthusiastically asking about our day. We would eat dinner together, joke, talk – be a normal family. Just be home.   Our drawings that he’d taped above his desk, his slippers outside the door, the coat he hung over his chair. All the little reminders that he was home. When we looked out our window facing the garden, we would often see him on his chair with our cat in his lap. His deep, melodious voice recited the Quran and floated over the wall to our neighbors’.  He would often excitedly call us outside just to show a cool bird or bug he had spotted.  That’s what had been doing the evening I saw him for the last time. I was 13 then. I’m 20 now. It’s been eight years since two black cars rolled into our street, masked and plainclothes men broke into our house, and abducted him. He never came home. I realize now, after that day, neither did I. I often try to explain what makes enforced disappearance so uniquely horrifying. If a family member is arrested with a warrant and put into prison, even if falsely, at least you know where they are. At least you can visit and speak to them. If someone dear to you is diagnosed with a fatal disease, at least you can cherish the days you have left and hold their hand by the hospital bed. If a loved one dies, even if suddenly, at least you have a body to mourn. As you see them being lowered six feet into the ground and watch the shower of sand filling their grave, at least you realize they are truly gone. And no matter how terrible it hurts, at least you have a grave to kneel over and cry on. At least you can accept they will never come home. When someone is wrenched from your home and forcibly disappeared, they are vanished without trace. Gone without a puff of smoke. No reason, no whereabouts, no contact. Nothing. Are they sick or healthy? Tortured or spared? Dead or alive? The complete absence of closure is not only what makes enforced disappearance the horror it is. It is also what never lets your heart accept that someone is truly gone. It bracingly, painfully, never lets you give up hope that one fine morning, the door will open and they’ll be home. It’s exhausting. As I trudge up the street on my way home from university, I look up at the house I’d grown to love. The cracked, gray marble steps, the ivy creeping up the walls and sneaking around the doorbell, and the gangly apricot tree we grew from a seed. When a person is disappeared, they are not just being picked up off the street. They are being snatched from a community, torn from a family and ripped from a home. A home that no longer remains a home without him. Because it takes the entire family to make one. His shoes are not outside the door. When I walk in, his desk still stands there, but empty. I walk slowly through, and look at all the changes he doesn’t know about yet. The sofa covers. The new rug on the floor. The scribbles of mine that he would tape above the desk have now grown into paintings. Every day, I live in the hope he’ll come back. Every day, I die when he doesn’t. Yet I still wake up in the morning. I pray that I never give up. Our loss and grief is heavy in the coolness of the house around me, but so is our resilience and struggle. Yet I know I can only truly come home when he does. This is a series of a blog written by Aymun Sajid. Aymun Sajid is the daughter of Sajid Mehmood, an IT engineer who was forcibly disappeared from his home in Islamabad on 14 March 2016. He remains missing to date and his loved ones have no information of his fate or whereabouts. The government of Pakistan must end the practice of enforced disappearance and secret and arbitrary detentions.

0,Campaign to decriminalize defamation and insult in Lebanese laws,AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2023/08/campaign-to-decriminalize-defamation-and-insult-in-lebanese-laws/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? Lebanese authorities and powerful individuals, including political, judicial, religious and security figures, are increasingly displaying intolerance towards criticism and are weaponizing Lebanon’s criminal defamation and insult laws to harass, intimidate and silence human rights defenders, activists, journalists and others who criticize them or try to expose their alleged misconduct or corruption. Convictions under these laws can result in up to three years’ imprisonment. This threat to peaceful dissent will hinder the ability of human rights defenders, journalists, activists and others to operate independently and speak out about important social, economic and rights issues. Public debate is especially critical at this time in Lebanon, a country blighted by economic and political turmoil, where the judiciary is failing to hold to account officials responsible for multiple crises and human rights violations. Here are the answers to five key questions about the right to freedom of expression and the use of repressive defamation laws in Lebanon. Defamation is any expression, written or spoken, communicated to another person, which may result in harming the reputation of a third person or institution. Most states have adopted some form of defamation laws to protect individuals and institutions from unwarranted attacks on their reputation. However, Lebanon’s defamation laws do not comply with the country’s obligations under international human rights law and are commonly used by the authorities and powerful individuals to harass, intimidate and punish individuals who are critical of them. Lebanese laws, namely the Penal Code, Publications Law and the Military Code of Justice, criminalize defamation and insults, including against public employees, officials, judges, the president, the flag, the army, and foreign states. There are two types of defamation: slander and libel. The Penal Code defines slander as every attribution that attaches an action to a person or institution which offends their honor or dignity. It defines libel as contempt, profanity or insult that appears in a means of publication and is directed against an individual or institution. Individuals accused of defamation or insults can be tried in the criminal courts, the Publications Court or the military courts. Convictions under these laws can lead to prison terms of up to three years and/or fines. For more about the penalties prescribed by different defamation and insult laws in Lebanon, please read our legal analysis here.  First, Lebanon’s defamation and insult laws are criminal, meaning that individuals or institutions who feel that they have been defamed or insulted can file a claim with the public prosecution, and then the security agencies and the prosecutors use public funds to investigate the case on behalf of the state, including summoning and interrogating individuals. Amnesty International has documented a range of violations during the interrogations at security agencies that are meant to harass and intimidate individuals. The courts can punish those found guilty of defamation and/or insults with imprisonment of up to three years. In July 2023, a criminal court sentenced journalist Dima Sadek to one year imprisonment over a tweet she published that was critical of members of one of the most prominent political parties in the country. Insult is not a recognizable offense under international human rights law. Further, under international human rights law, imprisonment is never an appropriate penalty for defamation. Civil damages are sufficient to redress harm to individuals’ reputation and strike a better balance between protecting individual rights and fostering a healthy public discourse. Our campaign calls on the Lebanese authorities to abolish articles in the Penal Code, the Publications Law and the Military Code of Justice that criminalize insults and to replace defamation articles with new civil provisions Second, the truth is not a defence in most cases of defamation and insult under Lebanese law. So individuals can be prosecuted – and even sentenced to prison – even if what they said is true. Third, public officials have special protection from defamation and insult. The penalties for defaming public officials are higher than for private citizens, and those penalties increase the higher the rank of the individual against whom the defamation or insult is directed. The president is especially protected under Lebanese law. The public prosecutor can file defamation charges against individuals who are accused of defaming the president on his own initiative, even without a complaint by the president. And the truth is never a defence for any insults or defamation directed at the president. International human rights law is clear that “all public figures, including those exercising the highest political authority such as heads of state and government, are legitimately subject to criticism and political opposition.” In fact, public officials should tolerate a greater latitude of public scrutiny from society given the public interest resulting in criticism of them. Fourth, Lebanese law allows for civilians to be tried in military courts if the alleged defamatory content was directed at any member of the military institution. Amnesty International has found that the military courts in Lebanon are not independent or impartial, and they violate people’s fair trial and due process rights. Yes! International human rights law does not permit restrictions or prohibitions on the right to freedom of expression simply on the grounds that others find it offensive. The UN Human Rights Committee, established to oversee the implementation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights by state parties, has emphasized that the scope of the right to freedom of expression “embraces even expression that may be regarded as deeply offensive.” It specifically expressed concerns regarding laws that prohibit disrespect for authority, flags, symbols, and institutions, emphasizing that such laws should not inhibit criticism of institutions, including the military.  Additionally, the “mere fact that forms of expression are considered to be insulting to a public figure is not sufficient to justify the imposition of penalties.” Amnesty International opposes all criminal defamation laws as well as all laws prohibiting insult or disrespect of heads of state or public figures, the military or other public institutions, flags or symbols.  International human rights standards provide a clear framework for how domestic law should strike a balance between the maximum protection for the right to freedom of expression on one hand and respect for the rights of others and the maintenance of national security and public order on the other. The right to freedom of expression can only be restricted in certain narrow circumstances, which are: for the respect of the rights or reputations of others; for the protection of national security, public order, public health or morals; or when the speech constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility, or violence. However, any restrictions for achieving the legitimate aims laid above must meet the requirements of legality, necessity and proportionality. The burden is on the state to demonstrate the necessity and proportionality of any restriction and the legitimate reason for which it is imposed. Any restrictions on the exercise of freedom of expression these may not put in jeopardy the right itself. As demonstrated above, criminal defamation and insult laws do not meet these thresholds. Properly framed, incitement laws are one of the permissible criminal restrictions on freedom of expression. However, the speech must advocate hatred of a particular national, racial or religious group; there must be a clear intent to incite others to discriminate, be hostile towards, or commit violence against the group in question; there must be a likelihood that others will commit such violence or other harm; and there must be a clear and direct link between the speech/expression and that violence or other harm. Jean Kassir, a journalist and co-founder of Megaphone, an independent media outlet, was summoned for interrogation in March 2023 by members of State Security, one of Lebanon’s intelligence agencies, who intercepted his car in his neighbourhood and did not inform him of the reasons behind the summons. Kassir later learned that the summons was based on a criminal defamation complaint filed by Lebanon’s top Public Prosecutor who was named as one of the “fugitives from justice” in the Beirut port explosion case in a post on Megaphone. The prosecutor was charged in the Beirut explosion case. Kassir refused to appear before State Security because he said it is not mandated to interrogate journalists. Popular mobilization and solidarity with Jean prompted the Prosecutor to drop the charges. Lara Bitar, editor-in-chief of the Public Source website, an investigative journalism outlet, was summoned for interrogation via a phone call from the Cybercrimes Bureau of the Internal Security Forces (ISF) who refused to explain the reasons behind the summons. Bitar also refused to attend the interrogation as she said security agencies are not mandated to interrogate journalists. Her lawyer, who appeared on her behalf, learned that the summons was based on a criminal defamation complaint submitted by the Lebanese Forces, a prominent Lebanese political party, in relation to an article published eight months earlier on the website accusing the party of alleged environmental crimes during and after the Lebanese Civil War (1975-1990). To date, Bitar’s lawyer has not been informed of further developments on her case. Gina al-Chammas, the president of Lebanon Certified Anti-Corruption Managers and former president of the Lebanese Association of Certified Public Accountants, appeared for interrogation on 4 July 2023 following a criminal defamation complaint filed against her by former minister and parliamentarian Nohad al-Machnouk over statements she made in the media about alleged corrupt activities by top officials and businessmen, including al-Machnouk. During the interrogation at the ISF’s Cybercrimes Bureau, her interrogators tried to pressure her into revealing the names of her sources and handing over documents in her possession, in violation of the whistle-blowers protection law that Lebanon passed in 2018. When al-Chammas refused to reveal her sources, the interrogators told her she would not be released until she signed a pledge to not make statements against al-Machnouk, which she refused to do. Six hours later, al-Chammas was released without signing a pledge, amid growing calls for public mobilization. Al-Chammas is waiting for notification of further developments in her case. Actor Ziad Itani who was acquitted on false espionage charges in 2017, is facing a criminal defamation trial before a criminal court following a defamation complaint filed against him in 2020 by the head of State Security and another senior State Security official, after Itani publicly criticized the agency for leaking a video of his interrogation to the media. Itani was detained at State Security in 2017, and he has accused the agency of forcibly disappearing and torturing him. Amnesty International documented his torture allegations, which included beating him with electric cables, tying his body in a stress position using an iron chain, hanging him by his wrists for hours, kicking and punching him in the face and threatening to rape him. While Itani’s torture complaints remain uninvestigated, the authorities acted quickly and swiftly to investigate and prosecute him over the defamation charges. Itani’s trial is ongoing. In July 2023, a criminal court sentenced journalist Dima Sadek to one year imprisonment and a fine of 110 million Lebanese pounds (equivalent to around 1200 USD at market rate) pursuant to criminal defamation and incitement charges filed against her by the leader of the Free Patriotic Movement, one of Lebanon’s most prominent political parties. The complaint is pursuant to a tweet she published in February 2020 in which she used insulting words to describe the party after some of its members allegedly committed violent acts. This judgment, an unprecedented escalation against peaceful dissent, stands out as one of the most severe verdicts issued in Lebanon against an individual related to peaceful expression. Meanwhile, the Lebanese authorities, including the prosecution and security institutions, must immediately stop harassing and intimidating those who are exercising their right to freedom of expression and respect their rights to due process.

0,Human rights under assault two years after President Saied’s power grab,AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2023/07/human-rights-under-assault-two-years-after-president-saieds-power-grab/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? Two years after President Kais Saied’s power grab, the state of human rights in Tunisia has continued to deteriorate. Institutional safeguards for their protection were almost entirely dismantled, the judiciary has lost guarantees for its independence, military courts have increasingly targeted critics of the president with repressive laws, while the right to freedom of expression has dramatically shrunk. Since 25 July 2021, courts have opened investigations and, in some cases, trials against at least 39 people for the peaceful exercise of their right to freedom of expression. Amnesty International has been monitoring and documenting the erosion of human rights in the country as well as the impact of President Saied’s decisions on human rights safeguards. On 25 July 2021, President Saied suspended parliament, dismissed the prime minister and took executive control of the country, citing emergency powers that he said were granted to him by the constitution. He has since dismantled most of the independent institutions that are key for human rights protection, such as an independent council to supervise the judiciary and an institution in charge of controlling whether new laws are consistent with Tunisia’s 2014 constitution, and granted himself nearly unchecked powers to govern. Twelve years after a revolution that ousted Tunisia’s long-term dictator, Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, who ruled the country with an iron fist and committed egregious human rights violations during his 23 years rule, the conditions for a return to a system of lack of respect for human rights and the rule of law are in place. Freedom of expression is under assault, freedom of association is threatened, while fair trial rights are trampled upon. Migrants, refugees and asylum seekers have been assaulted and arbitrarily arrested following hateful remarks by President Saied. The institutions that were considered a bulwark against abuse are either debilitated or dismantled. On 30 June 2022, President Saied put forward a draft constitution that would further consolidate his powers and imperil human rights. The constitution was issued after an obscure and fast-tracked drafting process without meaningful consultation of civil society organizations or political parties. In contrast, Tunisia’s’ previous 2014 constitution was drafted by an elected National Constituent Assembly through a two-year-long inclusive and transparent process and contained strong human rights safeguards. On 25 July 2022 the new constitution was adopted by referendum with 94% of the vote; turnout was just over 30%. The 2022 Constitution does not offer Tunisia’s judiciary the necessary safeguards to operate with full independence and impartiality, including because it grants the executive branch authority over the nomination, disciplining and dismissal of judges.  
 Unlike the 2014 constitution, the new constitution significantly weakens the right to a fair trial by removing a provision that prevented the trial of civilians before military courts. Furthermore, it contains worrying provisions that give leeway to authorities to use religion as grounds for legal amendments that are not aligned with Tunisia’s international human rights commitments. While the 2022 Constitution still upholds several key rights, it grants the president largely unchecked emergency powers and removes oversight mechanisms used to hold the authorities to account. Article 96 related to “exceptional measures” does not offer the safeguards required to protect human rights under a state of emergency. Contrary to the 2014 constitution, the article does not impose a time limit for the decision to be reviewed nor provide any avenues to challenge the exceptional measures. Since 25 July 2021, Tunisians including journalists, parliamentarians, political figures and a former president have all found themselves in the authorities’ crosshairs and have been prosecuted for opposing the president’s power grab. Notably, 21 people, including opposition figures, lawyers and businessmen, are under investigations in a so-called “conspiracy” case. At least seven people are currently arbitrarily detained in relation to this investigation including opposition activists Jaouhar Ben Mbarek and Issam Chebbi; politicians Khayam Turki and Abdelhamid Jelassi; and lawyers Ghazi Chaouachi and Ridha Belhaj. Authorities released activist Chaima Issa and lawyer Lazhar Akremi after significant campaigning for their release, but they are still being investigated on the same charges. Those arrested are being investigated in relation to trumped up charges of conspiracy under 10 articles of the Tunisian Penal Code including Article 72, which mandates the death penalty for trying to “change the nature of the state”. They also face a dozen charges under a 2015 counterterrorism law including Article 32, which mandates up to 20 years of imprisonment for “forming a terrorist organization”. Their arrest and detention stems from the exercise of their rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly, and association all of which are protected under international human rights treaties, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights to which Tunisia is a state party. None of them have been involved in acts that would amount to recognizable crimes under international law, and the charges against them are therefore unfounded. Tunisian authorities have particularly targeted members of Ennahda, the country’s largest opposition party, initiating criminal investigations against at least 21 leaders and members of the party and arresting at least 12. Its president, former speaker of the dissolved parliament, Rached Ghannouchi, was arrested on 17 April 2023 in a separate “conspiracy against the state” case involving at least 11 others. Ghannouchi is being investigated in various other criminal cases. On 15 May, Tunisia’s anti-terrorism court handed the 81-year-old a one-year prison sentence and a fine in connection with public remarks made at a funeral in February 2022, the first sentence against him since the 2011 revolution. Another senior Ennahda leader, former justice minister Noureddine Bhiri, was arrested on 13 February 2023 for attempting to “change the nature of the state” and also added to the conspiracy case. Noureddine Bhiri was previously arrested on 31 December 2021 and released without charge after 67 days of arbitrary detention. In April 2023, authorities conducted an extensive search of the Ennahda party’s headquarters in Tunis for a lengthy period of time after closing it and, according to the party, barred meetings from being held in its offices across the country.  Freedom of expression was one of the most important demands and gains of the 2011 revolution. Although many in Tunisia continue to criticise the president’s actions without penal consequences, courts including military tribunals, have prosecuted critics of the president for calling his actions a “coup”, or making statements that authorities deemed false or “insulting”. Since 25 July 2021, authorities have opened investigations against at least 39 people for peacefully expressing themselves, including under Decree-law 54: a new draconian cybercrime law that mandates heavy prison terms based on vague phrases such as “fake news” and gives authorities sweeping powers to monitor how people use the internet.Since its adoption on 13 September 2022, authorities have initiated investigations against at least nine individuals including journalists, lawyers and political activists. Nizar Bahloul, journalist and director of online news outlet Business News, is under investigation since November 2022 under Article 24 of the decree-law for an article criticizing the prime minister. Human rights lawyer Ayachi Hammami is also under investigation since December 2022 for radio remarks he made about the justice minister. If tried and convicted both could face up to 10 years in prison. Since 25 July 2021, President Saied has repeated threatening comments about civil society organizations. In a videotaped speech on 24 February 2022, he accused them of serving foreign interests. In the same speech, he said he intended to ban foreign funding of NGOs. Verbal attacks are not the only threat to Tunisia’s civic space. A draft law was leaked to civil society groups in Tunisia in January 2022. If adopted, the draft law would hinder their work by giving broad powers to authorities to interfere in the activities and funding of civil society organizations. The draft law would restore a Ben Ali-era requirement for government authorization before a civil society group may operate; regulate civil society groups’ activities and published material based on vague, overly broad considerations such as “threats to the unity of the state”; subject funding from abroad to prior approval by the Tunisian Central Bank; and allow authorities to dissolve civil society groups without judicial oversight. In November 2022, as Tunisia underwent its fourth Universal Periodic Review (UPR), authorities mentioned – in a written report and remarks delivered at the UN Human Rights Council – plans to amend the country’s law on associations without giving further details. President Kais Saied’s verbal attacks on the judiciary materialized into decree laws that undermined the independence of the judiciary and fair trial rights in Tunisia. Moreover, the constitution adopted on 25 July 2022 aligns with the president’s vision of the justice system as mere function of the state and not a separate, independent power with strong guarantees to protect it from government interference. The draft constitution enables the president to appoint judges by presidential decree as well opens the door for the government to undertake disciplinary procedures against judges instead of giving that prerogative exclusively to an independent institution.  This vision of the judiciary is reminiscent of how it functioned under Tunisia’s former dictator Ben Ali when judges and prosecutors were subject to his approval and influence. After Ben Ali’s ouster in 2011, Tunisian authorities created the High Judicial Council (HJC), to supervise the careers of magistrates and act as a bulwark against the executives interference.  Eleven years later, President Saied unilaterally dissolved the HJC. On 5 February 2022, following months of accusing the judiciary of corruption and negligence, he announced, in a videotaped speech at the Interior Ministry, that the High Judicial Council “should consider itself a part of the past as of this moment”. On 12 February 2022, Saied issued Decree-law 11, dissolving the council, replacing it with a new, temporary council and granting himself considerable sway over judicial careers and disciplinary procedures. On 1 June 2022, Saied tightened his control over the judiciary even further by issuing Decree-law 35, amending Decree-law 11, which gives the president the authority to fire judges and prosecutors at will. Under Decree-law 35, being fired by the president triggers criminal prosecution for the alleged misconduct in question. On the same day, a decree was published in the official gazette with the names of 57 judges whom President Saied had arbitrarily dismissed. On 10 August 2022, the Tunis Administrative Court ordered the reinstatement of 49 of the 57 arbitrarily dismissed judges and prosecutors, but Tunisian authorities failed to comply with the tribunal’s decision in complete disregard of the rule of law. Those men and women should have their rights to work and to fair trial reinstated as ordered by the court. Instead, they are currently at the mercy of the government’s arbitrary measures. On 1 June 2023, a year after President Saied arbitrarily dismissed the judges, Amnesty International and 36 international and national rights groups reiterated their call to revoke Decree-law 35. On 21 February 2023, President Saied made xenophobic and racist comments that triggered a wave of anti-Black violence including assaults, summary evictions, and arbitrary arrests of African foreign nationals. President Saied said that “hordes of irregular migrants from Sub-Saharan Africa” had come to Tunisia, “with all the violence, crime, and unacceptable practices that entails”. He said this was an “unnatural” situation and part of a criminal plan designed to “change the demographic make-up” and turn Tunisia into “just another African country that doesn’t belong to the Arab and Islamic nations anymore”. Following the president’s remarks, police in February 2023 arbitrarily arrested at least 840 migrants, refugees and asylum seekers in several cities in Tunisia. Some of them ended up arbitrarily detained in the infamous Ouardia detention centre, a facility used to detain people solely for migration-related offences. By mid-May, Amnesty International found that migrants remained indefinitely locked up without due process in Ouardia in terrible conditions and with no access to lawyers. Attacks against Black Africans also increased following the president’s hateful comments, with mobs taking to the streets and assaulting migrants, refugees and asylum seekers. Subsequent tensions in the coastal southern city of Sfax culminated in the death of a migrant in May and a Tunisian man in July, which were followed by collective expulsions of hundreds of Black African migrants and asylum seekers as reported by rights groups. It started with the president speaking about Black people. I didn’t listen to him but some of my flatmates started seeing things on Facebook, violence, mobs attacking migrants. A few days after the speech, there was a group of young men in front of the house, they were shouting, they had sticks, it was in the evening around 7pm, we didn’t know what to do. 
Treasure, migrant from Nigeria  For human rights and their safeguards in Tunisia, the two years since President Saied claimed sweeping powers on 25 July 2021 have been disastrous. President Saied has, attacked, threatened and dismantled key human rights and their safeguards.  Amnesty International calls on the Tunisian authorities to: The situation of human rights in Tunisia is fragile and calls for immediate action. Join us and urge the Tunisian authorities to ensure that they immediately release all those arbitrarily detained and to stop the prosecution of people simply for peacefully exercising their human rights.

0,Tunisia: Human rights at risk two years after President Saied’s power grab,AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2023/07/tunisia-human-rights-at-risk-two-years-after-president-saieds-power-grab/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? In the second year since Tunisian President Kais Saied’s power grab, Tunisian authorities have taken further steps towards repression by jailing dozens of political opponents and state critics, violated the independence of the judiciary, dismantled institutional human rights safeguards, and incited discrimination against migrants, Amnesty International said today.  “Decree by decree, blow by blow, President Saied and his government have dramatically undermined respect for human rights in Tunisia since his power grab in July 2021. In doing so, he has stripped away basic freedoms that Tunisians fought hard to earn and fostered a climate of repression and impunity. The Tunisian authorities must immediately reverse this treacherous trajectory and uphold their international human rights obligations,” said Heba Morayef, Amnesty International’s Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa. Since February 2023, the authorities have used bogus criminal investigations and arrests to target political opponents, state critics, and perceived enemies of President Saied. In one high-profile case, the authorities opened a criminal investigation against at least 21 people, including members of the political opposition, lawyers and businessmen on unfounded accusations of “conspiracy against the state.” At least seven people remain in arbitrary detention in relation to their political activism or speech, including opposition figures Jaouhar Ben Mbarek and Khayam Turki.  The Tunisian authorities have especially targeted members of Ennahda, the country’s largest opposition party, initiating criminal investigations against at least 21 members of the party, 12 of whom are in detention. Authorities arrested Rached Ghannouchi, the leader of Ennahda and the former speaker of Tunisia’s dissolved parliament, in April 2023 and are investigating him on charges that include “conspiracy against the state” and “trying to change the nature of the state.” On 15 May 2023, an anti-terrorism court sentenced him to one year in prison over public remarks he made last year at a funeral in which he praised the deceased a “courageous man” who did not fear “a ruler or tyrant”. Since 25 July 2021, Amnesty International has documented the cases of at least 39 people who have been investigated or prosecuted merely for exercising their right to freedom of expression. The charges against them include “insulting” the authorities or “spreading fake news,” which are not recognized offenses under international law. In a further blow, in September 2022, President Saied issued Decree-law 54, a draconian cybercrime decree-law that affords the authorities wide-ranging powers to crack down on freedom of expression online. Since its adoption, the authorities have used this law to initiate investigations against at least nine individuals, including journalists, lawyers and political activists over public comments critical of the authorities, including President Saied and Prime Minister Najla Bouden. In February 2023, President Saied made xenophobic and racist comments, which triggered a wave of anti-Black violence, including assaults, summary evictions, and arbitrary arrests of migrants of African origin. The police also arrested at least 840 migrants, refugees and asylum seekers. Some of them ended up in arbitrary detention in the Ouardia detention centre, a facility used solely for detaining people for migration-related offences.  Attacks against Black Africans increased significantly in the two weeks following the President’s comments, with mobs taking to the streets and assaulting migrants, refugees and asylum seekers and the police arbitrary arresting dozens. In May, racial tensions in the southern city of Sfax culminated in the death of a migrant and in July of a Tunisian man. Following the deaths, the authorities forcibly removed dozens of Black African migrants and asylum seekers into neighbouring Libya.  “The authorities must take immediate steps to protect the rights of Black African foreign nationals, including migrants, asylum seekers and refugees. They must also stop arbitrarily detaining them or forcibly removing them from the country, especially without considering whether they will suffer from persecution upon being returned.”  In February 2022, President Saied accused civil society groups of serving the interests of foreign powers and said he intended to ban “funding from abroad”,  the authorities leaked a draft of a restrictive new law on the creation of associations. If adopted, the legislation would remove crucial protections covering the right to freedom of association. The draft is an amendment of Decree-law 2011-88, which regulates civil society associations and grants them the right to exist and operate freely.   President Saied has undermined judicial independence by issuing two decrees granting himself the power to intervene in the careers of judges and prosecutors, including the power to arbitrarily dismiss them. On 1 June 2022, Saied dismissed 57 judges based on vague and politically motivated accusations of terrorism, financial or moral corruption, adultery, and participation in “alcohol-fuelled parties.”  President Saied consolidated power on 25 July 2022 after a new Constitution he proposed was adopted in a referendum. The Constitution, which was presented after a fast-tracked drafting process and without meaningful consultation with civil society organizations or other political parties, increased Saied’s powers and weakened the independence of the judiciary, actions that threaten to pull the country back to pre-2011 levels of repression.  “The Tunisian authorities must immediately cease their crackdown on human rights, which is steadily undoing the hard-won achievements of the 2011 revolution.

Barry fought back the tears as he explained to Amnesty International what had happened to his dream of a future, not just for himself but for the coming generations. Tourism is a major source of income for Gambia, but tourism to experience the natural beauty of the Gambian coast requires the beaches and fabulous landscape to be protected. All of that is now under threat. In 2006, Sanyang started to develop its potential for tourism. Some members of the local community invested in lodges and restaurants to host tourists who wanted to enjoy the spectacular beaches, unspoiled nature and the local fresh fish cuisine. Many, like Barry, saw this activity as an opportunity to invest in their community, providing training for young people, giving them an opportunity to make a decent living and discouraging them from making dangerous journeys to Europe in search of a better life. A thriving tourism industry promised to help end irregular migration that was depriving communities of their youth and therefore their future. Barry bought into that dream. In the 1990s, Barry decided to give up his job in a five-star hotel in Banjul and come back home to Sanyang to set up his own business. Since then, he has trained many young people from the community, investing in them, giving them opportunities and jobs. In 2018, his dream was shattered. I do not regret coming here but if I could have foreseen the factory, I would not be here… Now there are less chances for tourism to survive and the less chances for the youth to have opportunities in the community.” Nessim Fishing and Fish Processing Co., Ltd (Nessim) set up shop just 100m from his restaurant – according to the community, there was not enough consultation and information about what the impact on them might be and promised job opportunities from the factory for local people proved an illusion. The impact for Barry has been devastating. The tourism idyll was turned into a financial and ecological nightmare – awful smells, smoke and dead fish on the shore. There are three fishmeal and fish oil factories in Gambia. These factories transform pelagic fish into fish oil or a powder called fishmeal which is then used to feed farm animals and other fish, like salmon, in the aquaculture industry, usually in Europe, Asia and America. It takes about 4.5kg of fish to make 1kg of fishmeal. Fish oil is also used in food supplement capsules. Nessim, a Mauritanian-owned company, was the last of the three factories to be opened in Gambia.  The impact on Sanyang and its people has been profound in a number of ways and the unsustainable level of fishing required to feed these factories is having a devastating impact on the area and the community, which risks becoming irreversible. Barry is not the only one that feels a sense of helplessness and frustration. All the lodges and restaurant owners that Amnesty International talked to shared similar stories, including their collective realization that the Gambian authorities are not doing enough to protect them or remedy this situation. For Barry, like others in the tourism industry, overfishing by the factory and foreign trawlers has led to a shortage of fish, leading to a rise in the cost of fish, putting at risk the economic viability of his business. But the consequences go far beyond that. For Barry the factory is tearing his dream of a vibrant community apart little by little. Fast and effective government action to address the problems facing Barry and others in the tourism industry is vital to stop irreversible harm to the people, their environment and their futures. Yet so far that action has been lacking. *A pseudonym has been used to protect the interviewee’s security and privacy. Listening to the voices of Sanyang and the stories of suffering from members of the community, it is hard to understand why the Gambian authorities are failing to act to defend the human rights of the people affected by the fishmeal factory and foreign trawlers. Clearly, the voices of those championing the benefits of profits are louder and stronger – but the profits are not reaching the people paying the price for mass exploitation of Gambia’s coastal waters. No matter who shouts loudest, the Gambian authorities have responsibilities that they must fulfil – including ensuring the rights of the population to food, work, health and a safe environment. The Gambian government has a duty to protect these rights and pass legislation requiring companies to conduct human rights due diligence in their operations and supply chains and ensure proper monitoring of Gambia’s waters. It also has an obligation to ensure transparency and allow easy public access to information about fishmeal factories and foreign trawlers and investigate the possible detrimental impact of their operations. The Nessim fishmeal factory must be transparent about its activities, regularly consult with the community and follow the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, including by putting in place an ongoing and proactive human rights due diligence process to identify, prevent, mitigate and address the factory’s impact on human rights. Given the potential high economic and environmental impact of its activities, it must phase out the use of fish that according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization are already overexploited, such as sardinella and bonga fish. Companies in the supply chain of fishmeal factories also have a role to play. They need to conduct supply chain due diligence and publicly disclose their due diligence policies and practices, in accordance with international standards, and take action, in cooperation with other relevant actors, to mitigate or remediate any harm caused. Responsibilities for the situation also lie further afield. The international community, including countries that have signed fishing agreements with Gambia, need to regulate the aquaculture industry to limit the use of fishmeal and fish oil made from already overexploited species and increase transparency regarding their supply chain. They cannot carry on closing their eyes and ears because the sights and smells of Sanyang are far from them – out of sight must not mean out of mind. Join Amnesty International members and supporters in their campaign to protect Gambia’s coastal waters, marine resources and communities. Act now by emailing the President of Gambia, Adama Barrow, to demand that he ensures the implementation of Amnesty International’s recommendations.   The members of the communities affected by the overexploitation of the seas through the activities of Nessim Fishmeal Factory and foreign industrial trawlers are sharing their stories with us. These firsthand stories are meant to let you know more about why we’re standing with Sanyang to save Gambian seas and protect Gambian communities rights.

Malawi is a landlocked country mainly dependent on agricultural exports like tobacco and tea for revenue. 70.1% of Malawi’s population lives below USD 2.15 a day, making it one of the poorest countries in the world. Climate events such as flooding, drought and cyclones have devastated the agricultural sector – the main lifeline for both citizens and the government. The Constitution of the Republic of Malawi provides for the progressive implementation of healthcare for all, commensurate with needs. Many people in Malawi, however, do not enjoy the right to adequate healthcare – those most affected are the poor and vulnerable living in rural areas. The country’s indebtedness, poor budget management, corruption, reliance on donor funding, and exposure to severe climate disasters mean that the government is unable to ensure that people in Malawi can access the right to health, as committed to in the sustainable development goals, the Constitution, the Abuja declaration and several other legal, policy and regulatory proclamations., including the ratification of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (1993) and signature of the Africa Charter on Human and People’s Rights (1990). In 2000, Malawi qualified for debt cancellation and restructuring under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative. The country, however, only completed this process and received relief in 2006. Simultaneously it obtained further relief through the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (started in 2005). These interventions reduced debt from over 100% of GDP to less than 20%. Vulnerability to external shocks, Covid-19 and climate events, however, meant debt grew to 66% by 2022. Most of the country’s debt is owed to foreign creditors, but since the 2013 ‘cashgate’ corruption scandal, both aid and external financing has declined, pushing domestic borrowing upwards. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank classify Malawi as currently being in debt distress and public debt is believed to be unsustainable. In November 2022 Malawi received USD 88.3 million in funding from the IMF to supplement resources for food security. The country has been placed under a 12-month staff-monitored program (IMF) aimed at reducing corruption, enhancing revenue, and improving expenditure. Conditions of accessing additional funding include: The above conditions may not seem very onerous, but for Malawi, with limited capacity, and unending challenges in resource management, they may well be. For a government to improve capacity and capability, they require dedicated technical assistance and resources – over and above the day-to-day running of the country. In 2022, health expenditure was 8.8% of government’s budget – well below the Abuja Declaration of 15%. The figure shows that more than half of total health expenditure is made up of aid, meaning government has limited control in expenditure decisions and is vulnerable to the vagaries of international aid politics. Additionally, with 89% of the population employed in the informal economy, many are excluded from private medical insurance, with a significant proportion of  out-of-pocket expenditure exacerbating the poverty gap. Primary health care services are insufficient to meet need with many secondary and tertiary level health facilities being relied upon to provide these services. High inflation (15.9% average 2012 – 2020) and the reliance on donor funding makes financing for health unpredictable. The Covid-19 pandemic showed that planning, budgeting, and spending execution in health emergencies is lacking. Given the history of drought and flooding in the country, this is worrisome. Corruption also plagues the health sector. In the past, funds have allegedly been misused in the handling of medicines, and vulnerable citizens have been put at risk by being forced to make informal payments to receive treatment.  Following the “cashgate” scandal in 2013, there was a significant reduction in donor funds. In 2020 and 2021, however, donors stepped up to provide 80% of emergency funding in response to Covid-19, but further corruption and the disappearance of some of these funds has meant government is working hard to rebuild trust. In January 2023, Malawi published the latest Health Financing Strategy Plan (HFSP III) (2023 – 2030). It is based on commitments made by the country globally, regionally, and locally and aims to achieve universal health coverage. Despite the sizable contribution of aid to health financing, there remains a funding gap of over 50% of total costs. This is not helped by the 32.2% of the health budget lost to global tax abuse (mostly by multinationals), annually. Its inability to generate sufficient revenues puts it in a vicious cycle of dependency on donor aid and loans. The HFSP III provides an extensive explanation of the challenges currently faced in the health sector and the changes envisaged – but remains unproven in tackling these challenges effectively. In the interim, people must rely on their own limited incomes, donors, and humanitarian initiatives to address their unmet health needs arising from poor planning, emergency situations and natural disaster fallouts. An unfortunate paradox in Malawi is the dissonance between the constitutional promise of healthcare for all and the harsh reality. The fallout of instances of corruption and the pressures of inflation and rising debt has had a crippling effect on healthcare access. And with limited opportunity to significantly increase government tax revenue, Malawi is likely to remain a low-income country for the foreseeable future. The country, however, can strengthen its resource management by preventing and combating corruption; reviewing its tax incentives and tax treaties to ensure revenues are not unnecessarily foregone; reducing its debt burden, in consultation with creditors, to ensure funds are not diverted from providing available, accessible, acceptable, and quality healthcare; and improving the efficiency and effectiveness of spending.

0,Human Rights Violations in Cameroon’s Anglophone North-West Region,AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2023/06/human-rights-violations-in-cameroons-anglophone-north-west-region/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? Amnesty International’s report on how people of the North-West region are caught between the army, armed separatists and militias  Amnesty International’s latest report on Cameroon documents crimes under national law and human rights violations – including unlawful killings, murders, sexual violence and abductions – committed by the Cameroon defence and security forces, militias, and armed separatists in the Anglophone North-West region in recent years. Activists and others speaking out about what is happening have faced reprisals, both from the authorities and the armed separatists. In this context various state partners of Cameroon have continued their military cooperation and the supply of military equipment to Cameroon without providing information on any mitigating measures in place to ensure their assistance do not contribute to serious human rights violations and crimes committed by armed separatists, army forces and militias in the Anglophone regions. In late 2016, thousands of people in Cameroon’s Anglophone North-West and South-West regions, including lawyers, teachers, students and human rights defenders, took to the streets to denounce what they saw as the growing marginalisation of Anglophone linguistic, educational and judicial systems, and the failure to improve Anglophone political representation. Some demonstrators also called for greater autonomy or secession for Anglophone regions. The security forces responded to these largely peaceful demonstrations with brutal violence – including unlawful killings – and arrested hundreds of people, many of whom remain arbitrarily detained to this day In late 2017, separatist movements emerged, proclaiming the independence of the North-West and South-West regions as the ‘Federal Republic of Ambazonia’. Violent clashes ensued between the Cameroonian military and armed separatists, known collectively as ‘Ambas’ (Ambazonians), and continue to this day. Numerous peace initiatives have failed, and armed violence has become entrenched.  Indeed, armed separatists are still very active, despite losses and divisions into various factions. They have a presence all over the Anglophone regions and are well-established in hard-to-reach rural areas. They have strengthened their weapons arsenal and continue to target state structures, including outside the Anglophone regions. Armed separatists also target anyone suspected of supporting the government, or not adhering to their cause.   Cameroonian defence and security forces also continue to lead attacks against the separatists – and against people suspected of supporting them. On both sides, it seems that people are perceived as ‘with us or against us’, and face reprisals accordingly.   Amid the fighting between the Cameroonian military and armed separatists, long-standing land conflicts between Mbororo Fulani herders, and farmers from other ethnic groups in the North-West region, are also fuelling armed violence. The Mbororo Fulani are perceived to support the authorities and as such are particularly targeted by armed separatists. Some people have used the Anglophone crisis as a pretext to settle old disputes with the Mbororo Fulani, and there are many examples of discriminatory and inflammatory speech targeting this population, accusing them of being ‘outsiders’ and calling for their expulsion from the region. On the other hand, pro-government armed militias, mainly composed of Mbororo Fulani, have also committed abuses against the population. Both the Cameroonian military and armed separatists have committed atrocities against the population in the North-West region. The Cameroonian army has perpetrated serious human rights violations, including unlawful killings, sexual violence, the destruction of houses, and the harassment and detention of those speaking out about the crisis. Armed separatists have perpetrated serious crimes under domestic law such as murders, abductions, acts of torture, and destruction of houses. Although the situation does not qualify as armed conflict, all these atrocities remain absolutely prohibited under Cameroonian law and international human rights law.  On 17 December 2022, members of the Cameroonian army killed three people and destroyed at least 10 houses in a village in Bui division. The incident was reported to be in retaliation for an earlier attack on the army by armed separatists in the area. A village resident shared his harrowing account with Amnesty International: he was startled from his sleep by loud noises and emerged from his home to see some of his neighbours’ houses in flames. Fearing for his own safety, he quickly ran to grab a few possessions. As soon as he came to the door he saw 11 soldiers, all in military uniforms. They asked him in French: “Where are the Amba boys you keep in the village?” When he truthfully said he did not know of the whereabouts of any separatists, one of the soldiers reacted aggressively, forcefully pushing him down and subsequently ordering fellow soldiers to set his house ablaze. A soldier who was holding a five-litre gallon of petrol, proceeded to douse the house with it and ignited the flames.   Some armed Mbororo Fulani have also been perpetrators of violence (including killings, the burning of homes and land, and stealing cattle), sometimes in collaboration with defence and security forces. For example, on 14 February 2020, Cameroonian military and armed Mbororo Fulani massacred 21 people in Ngarbuh, including 13 children.   The government has at times announced investigations and prosecutions of certain human rights violations committed by the armed forces, but beyond the opening of the trial more than two years ago on the Ngarbuh massacre, no further information has been made available on the progress of the cases, raising concerns about de facto impunity in these cases.  When I started screaming, they said:  “Stop the noise or we will kill you!” I remained calm and a few minutes after my house was burned down, I left the village on foot for Jakiri, where I am currently seeking refuge. On the night of 28 March 2022, a horrifying incident took place in the village of Mbokop-Tanyi. Armed separatists attacked a Mbororo Fulani compound, including a home where a woman and her seven-year-old child and six-month-old baby had been sleeping. They first shot the woman, and then proceeded to burn the house with all three of them inside, killing all of them. The woman’s husband, who was not present, said that he never had “any problem either with Amba Boys or anyone in the village” before the attack. He told Amnesty International in despair: “One of my brothers called me the next morning to tell me that the Amba Boys had burned down my house, with two of my children and my wife inside.”  On 3 September 2021, Monica, who was just 20 at the time, was terrified as she saw the Cameroonian military arrive in her village (Ngie) and start attacking homes, apparently in retaliation for the killing of one of their troops by separatists earlier that day. She told Amnesty International how she grabbed her baby daughter and ran to hide in the house, but the soldiers kicked the door down. They ordered her husband to lie on the floor, and told Monica to leave her daughter to one side. A soldier then raped Monica. As her husband attempted to defend her, they shot him three times: in his head, his chest and his stomach. After about an hour, they took Monica and her daughter outside and set their house on fire. They drove them to an army camp, where they were held with six others. The youngest of these was just 12. Every day, they raped them one after the other. After more than 75 days, Monica and the others were released after one of the soldiers agreed to help them and alerted his commanding officer to what was happening in the camp. But by that time, three of the girls were already dead. Monica later gave birth to twins as a result of the rape.   ‘Annie’ also reports that she was having dinner with her grandparents in 2021 when the Cameroonian military burst in and shot her grandparents dead, then raped her repeatedly.   They wanted to rape me. They did. A military man raped me there. My husband tried to defend us and they shot him three times in the head, stomach and chest. Since 2017, several hundred Mbororo Fulani people have reportedly been killed in the North-West region. They are also targeted for abductions in exchange for ransom, and armed separatists have been burning their homes and taking their cattle. For example, Mohamed, a Mbororo herder, was told the Mbororo were not supporting the Ambas and would be driven out of the region. He was abducted on four separate occasions in 2019 and tortured with machetes, before he paid ransoms and was set free. While Mbororo Fulani have not necessarily been targeted by armed separatists more than other groups, attacks on them often appear to be accompanied or fuelled by discriminatory speech identifying them as ‘outsiders’ who should leave the Anglophone regions.   The political and judicial authorities have responded to this situation with further human rights violations. Separatist political leaders and members of civil society, including journalists, have been tried and sentenced by military courts for terrorism-related offences, even though military courts should not in any circumstances have jurisdiction over civilians according to international and regional human rights standards. People accused of being armed separatists, or supporting them, have at times been arbitrarily arrested and detained. Meanwhile, very little information has been made available on genuine investigations into the crimes committed by armed separatists against the population, leaving many victims of these crimes without justice.   Indeed, the grievances that fueled the Anglophone crisis have no doubt been exacerbated by the treatment of people by the justice system – apparent impunity for violations allegedly committed by the Cameroonian military, but many arbitrary detentions and unfair trials for the Anglophones. Indeed, more than 1,000 Anglophones remained in detention across the country as of January 2022, and many dozens of these people have demonstrably been arbitrarily arrested, sentenced and detained. These include the demonstrators whose protests marked the beginning of the crisis, alleged separatists, and activists denouncing the situation. There have also been many apparent attempts to silence human rights defenders, activists, academics, lawyers and journalists who speak out against atrocities committed in the context of armed violence in Cameroon’s Anglophone regions. Those denouncing or documenting atrocities committed by either side have often found themselves detained, harassed and targeted with death threats.   For example, peace activist Abdul Karim Ali was taken into custody at a military base in August 2022, and has been held in detention ever since, most recently at Kondengui central prison in Yaoundé. Charges against him include ‘hostility to the fatherland’, ‘secession’ and ‘rebellion’. While he has not been shown evidence to support these accusations, he has been interrogated repeatedly about a video he made on 9 July 2022 denouncing a Cameroonian military chief known as ‘Moja Moja’ for reportedly torturing civilians.  Akem Kelvin Nkwain, a human rights officer at the Centre for Human Rights and Democracy in Africa (CHRDA) received several death threats from alleged armed separatists in 2022, after tweeting about a child killed by an improvised explosive device (IED) allegedly planted by separatist fighters. Messages included an image of himself being marked for killing, and the words: ‘We declare you and your whole entire family as traitors and enemies to the Ambazonian fighters.’   Since the beginning of the armed violence, the Cameroon government has invested significantly in resources for the military. On the other side, armed separatists’ weapons are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Amnesty International has documented that they are in possession of weapons originating from various countries including Russia, Israel and Belgium, as well as weapons taken from the Cameroonian army.   In this context of armed violence riddled with multiple credible allegations of grave human rights violations, Cameroon’s international partners, including France, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Israel, Croatia, Serbia and Russia have continued to cooperate with the country militarily, including through the supply of arms and military equipment. Amnesty International underlines the risk that the military equipment provided by Cameroon’s partners could be used by army forces, militias, or armed separatists to commit crimes in the Anglophone regions.  If you are talented and passionate about human rights then Amnesty International wants to hear from you. © 2024 Amnesty International","['\nCameroon\n', '\nCampaign\n', '\nCampaigns\n', '\nReport\n', '\nResearch\n']",,True
0,"Public debt, tax reform and the right to health in Burundi",AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2023/06/public-debt-tax-reform-and-the-right-to-health-in-burundi/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? Burundi has, over the years, been beset with civil wars, ethnic violence, poverty, and economic instability. In 2008, Burundi became so indebted that it was included on the World Bank’s list of Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC). Its inclusion on the HIPC list qualified it to be admitted to multilateral debt relief initiatives of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The IMF-led debt cancellation and restructuring programmes have however failed to comprehensively address Burundi’s debt problem. Like most countries, Burundi was hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic, resulting in reduced capacity to both service debt and realize socio-economic rights obligations to its citizens. For instance, Burundi’s allocation to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programmes was reduced from 1.9% in the 2019-2020 financial year to 0.9% in 2020-2021. To find reprieve, Burundi participated in the G20-sponsored Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) which allowed the country to postpone paying interest on some of its debts, as well as provided debt relief of USD 0.93 million in 2021 from the Exim Bank of China and Kuwait Fund. In 2020, Burundi obtained USD 150 million from the IMF under the Catastrophe Containment Relief Trust. In 2021, it borrowed another USD 76 million from the IMF Rapid Credit Facility to support its response to, and recovery from the pandemic. These reprieves were not enough to enable a full post-Covid recovery. Consequently, by 2022, Burundi was once again deep in debt, with public debt at 66% of GDP, which although considered by the IMF  as sustainable, put the country at high risk of debt distress. To date, Burundi’s domestic debt to GDP stands at 46% owed largely to Burundi’s central bank and holders of government bonds and treasury bills, although foreign-owned debt has been increasing. Burundi has made efforts to raise domestic revenue. Seven new tax measures were implemented, including a new tax on mobile phone megabits, and a widening of the rental tax base. While this appears to have boosted revenue from 18.5 % of GDP in the 2020-2021 financial year to 18.8% of GDP in 2021-2022, Burundi remains heavily reliant on donor funding – particularly in the health sector. External resources accounted for 15.2% of funding for Burundi’s 2022-2023 budget. Although Burundi’s revenue to GDP ratio has been on a steady increase, even during the civil war when rapid military spending boosted tax revenue, most of current tax revenue (38%) is derived from indirect taxes on goods and services which disproportionately affect the poor. Curbing systemic corruption has been cited as one of the ways of improving tax revenue. For instance, Afrobarometer reported in 2014 that 46% of respondents believed that “most” or “all” Burundi tax officials are corrupt. The IMF estimates that tax exemptions amount to the equivalent of 18.3% of total Burundian revenues. Burundi is one of the top 5 least developed countries in the world and the poorest in sub-Saharan Africa. Its National Health Development Plan and national health policy have ambitions of providing universal health coverage (UHC) but currently, free healthcare is only provided to children below 5 years old, pregnant mothers, and retirees and their dependents. Maternal and child mortality remains high at 334 deaths per 100,000 live births, and 78 deaths per 1,000 live births.   To aggravate matters, Burundi’s high inflation rate has had a negative impact on social determinants of health and therefore the health system. The overall inflation between July 2021 and July 2022 was 19.1%, thus reducing the spending power of households. According to UNICEF, “64% of Burundian children are deprived of at least 3 of the 7 dimensions of child well-being, namely education, food, water, sanitation, protection, shelter and information”. Burundi relies heavily on donor funding to supplement its health budget. However, donor funding focuses on immunization, HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria leaving other vital areas underfunded. Consequently, 52% of Burundian children are malnourished. Despite signing the Abuja Declaration, which seeks to increase government spending on health to at least 15% of its national budget, Burundi’s allocations to health, including donor funds, consistently fall short of this target. In the 2022-2023 budget, Burundi allocated only 9.6% of its budget to health. To increase public investment, the country has allocated 56% of the 2022-2023 health budget to health investment which includes the building of hospitals, and buying of equipment and technology. Following the late President Nkurunziza’s contested third-term run for the presidency, subsequent political upheavals, sanctions and withdrawal of donor support, the country opted to undertake massive cuts in social spending. This resulted in a significant reduction in health spending in 2016 as indicated below. In view of the increasing internal and external pressures such as public debt and revenue shortfalls, global challenges such as climate change, Covid-19 aftershocks, and the disruptive effects of the war in Ukraine on commodity prices, Burundi continues to face budgetary deficits that undermine investment in health. The situation has been compounded by rapid corruption and political uncertainties which threaten the country’s social stability. The easing of sanctions in November 2021, and renewed donor engagement, however, should support Burundi’s economic recovery. For this to happen, Burundi should prioritize social spending, promote transparency and accountability, undertake tax reform – including the curbing of tax exemptions – and manage inflation. At the global level, lenders should prioritize debt relief to enable Burundi to cope with global crises, while addressing pressing socio-economic rights issues.

0,Case on the fight against forced and early marriage in Mali,AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2023/06/case-on-the-fight-against-forced-and-early-marriage-in-mali/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? In 2009, the National Assembly of Mali drafted a new Code of Persons and the Family with the aim of modernizing its legislation. The law, while welcomed by human rights defenders, is strongly opposed by Islamic organizations. Under this pressure, a new version was drafted and was adopted by the National Assembly and then promulgated by the President of Mali in 2011. This 2011 law allows marriage for girls from the age of 16, and in certain circumstances, from the age of 15. In addition, the law recognizes the validity of religious marriages which can be conducted between non-consenting people, who are sometimes minors, and in some cases are not even present at their own wedding. This law also says that Islamic law and custom apply in matters of inheritance, which means that women receive half of what male heirs receive, and children who are born out of wedlock do not receive inheritance only if the parents decided so before they died. The Association for the Progress and Defense of Women’s Rights (APDF), a Malian NGO, as well as the Institute for Human Rights and Development in Africa (IHRDA), a pan-African NGO, alarmed by the 2011 law, looked for ways to challenge it. However, there is no recourse in Mali against laws adopted in parliament, even if these are contrary to the constitution or to the treaties that the country has ratified. These two NGOs then directly submitted a complaint to the African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights to denounce the violations of the rights of women and children in Mali through this law. In its judgment of 11 May 2018, the African Court concluded that the minimum age of marriage must be 18 for both men and women, that the free consent of those concerned must be compulsory, and that the right of women and all children to receive an inheritance indiscriminately should be protected. The judges reminded Mali that, by ratifying the Maputo Protocol on the Rights of Women and the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, the country has undertaken an obligation to eliminate practices and traditions that undermine the rights of women and children – and this law, on the contrary, perpetuates them. The African Court thus ordered Mali to modify its law within 2 years to bring it into line with its international obligations, as well as to take measures to inform, teach, educate and sensitize the populations to these issues. Such a judgment has the potential to change the lives of thousands of women, girls and boys in Mali so that everyone can enjoy their right to wait until they are adults before marrying, freely choose their partner and receive an inheritance in a fair way.

On 13 December 1998, Norbert Zongo, an investigative journalist in Burkina, his two collaborators and his younger brother, were assassinated. Their bodies were found charred in the car in which they were traveling together. The police arrived the same day at the scene of the crime, and the prosecutor arrived the next day. The Burkinabe judicial system is seized and begins an investigation to determine the circumstances of this assassination. The journalist Norbert Zongo was investigating political, economic and social scandals, in particular concerning the death of the driver of the brother of the president at the time, which could have earn him enemies in high places. A suspect was charged in 2001. However, more than seven years after the opening of the investigation, in July 2006, the judge in charge of the case issued a dismissal order. The appeals of the Zongo family did not change anything, the justice abandoned the case. At that time, although the first judges of the African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights had already been appointed, it was not yet fully functional. The Court became operational in 2010, and the Zongo family, with the association the Burkinabe Movement for Human and Peoples’ Rights (MBDHP), having never abandoned their quest for justice, brought the case to the Court in December 2011. On 28 March 2014, the Court concludes that the legal proceedings were abnormally prolonged for years and that the charges were dropped before the culprits were found and tried, and thus, Burkina Faso failed to bring justice to the relatives of Zongo, his two collaborators and his brother. In addition, the Court considered that Burkina Faso’s failure to find and try the murderers of journalist Zongo also aroused fears and concerns in media circles, and that the State had thereby violated the right freedom of expression for journalists who no longer felt protected. The African Court then ordered Burkina Faso to pay financial reparations to the wives, sons and daughters, fathers and mothers of the deceased for the psychological suffering they endured, as well as to resume investigations in order to seek, prosecute and judge the perpetrators of the murders of Norbert Zongo and his three companions. The families, who no longer had any possible recourse in Burkina Faso, saw this judgment open up a new path to finally obtain the truth about what had happened and justice for their loved ones. [post judgment: Burkina Faso has compensated grieving families, and took over their quest for justice. The investigation was reopened and progressed in record time. An international arrest warrant was issued in May 2017 against François Compaoré, the brother of the former president. The challenge was that the main suspect in the murder of Zongo, had fled to France. However, he was arrested in 2017 following Burkina Faso’s request and since then there has been a legal battle between Compaoré’s lawyers and the French authorities. The lawyers are trying all possible recourses to prevent extradition to Burkina Faso, Compaoré’s country of origin, where he would be brought before a court.] Every year, our global community comes together to fight injustice and support people whose human rights are under threat.

0,Case on death-row detainees challenging mandatory death penalty,AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2023/06/case-on-death-row-detainees-challenging-mandatory-death-penalty/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? Five men were sentenced to death following the murder of another man in 2011. In 2015, after unsuccessful appeals against their judgment and sentence, they brought their case to the African Court. They were still in death row waiting for their execution in Tanzania when their case was examined. The African Court found that the five men had had a fair trial and there was no reason to reopen the question of their guilt. However, the Court said that they should not have been automatically sentenced to death. Indeed, the judges consider that Tanzanian law imposing death penalty in case of murder is arbitrary. Mandatory death penalty contradicts fairness and judicial independence, and as a consequence, violates the right to life. The Court also held that the execution of the death penalty by hanging amounts to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment given the inherent suffering involved¹. The Court ordered Tanzania to rehear the case on the sentencing, so as to give full liberty to the Tanzanian judge to decide whether to order the death penalty or whether to consider other punishment for these men. In addition, the Court ordered Tanzania to change its law and remove the mandatory imposition of the death penalty from its Penal Code within one year. The prohibition of mandatory death penalty, as violation of the right to life, is a landmark decision by the African Court. Although Amnesty International is against the death penalty in all cases without exception, this judgment provides an important step forward in that regard. It has the potential to save the lives of people who would otherwise be sentenced to death without second thought allowed, regardless of their personal circumstances or the context in which a crime was committed.

0,Advisory opinion of the Court requesting the abrogation of vagrancy laws,AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2023/06/advisory-opinion-of-the-court-requesting-the-abrogation-of-vagrancy-laws/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? A majority of countries in Africa¹ have some type of “vagrancy laws”, meaning laws which consider people that are or are perceived to be poor, homeless or unemployed as criminals. Examples are laws against “vagrants” or “vagabonds” defined as people who do not have a fixed home or livelihood, laws against “suspected person or reputed thief who has no visible means of substance and cannot give a good account of themselves”, or laws forbidding people of “being an idle and disorderly person”. In 2018, the Pan African Lawyers Union (PALU), a Pan-African lawyers’ association, decided to go to the African Court to ask for its opinion with regards to the compatibility of these laws with African human rights law. On 4 December 2020, the African Court issued a comprehensive advisory opinion demonstrating that these laws, by their nature and their application, violate many rights of the people punished by them. The judges found that vagrancy laws criminalize the perceived status of an individual and, because they target “the poor and underprivileged, including but not limited to the homeless, disabled, gender-nonconforming, sex workers, hawkers, street vendors”, further discriminate those who are already vulnerable and marginalized. These laws also label the people they target with derogatory terms which, as judges said, are “a reflection of an outdated largely colonial perception of individuals without any rights” and dehumanize these individuals. For all these reasons alone, these laws violate the right to dignity of these people, deprive them of their equality before the law and are discriminatory². In addition, the judges found that when enforcing these laws, police officers can arrest people without the need to prove they have done any crime. These people can be arbitrarily arrested and detained, or forcibly relocated somewhere else, just for the way they look or the location where they are standing. These situations violate the rights to liberty and security, to the freedom of movement, and the presumption of innocence³ of the people they punish. The judges also recalled that sometimes these laws even lead children being arrested or forcibly relocated from their areas of residence, which also violates the right to family and the children’s rights to not be discriminated against and to have their best interests protected. In conclusion, the African Court is of the opinion that all African States, which have all ratified the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights except Morocco, have an obligation to amend or repeal their vagrancy laws. This opinion could therefore have great impact on the continent: if those recommendations are followed, it could significantly improve the protection of those most vulnerable in the streets.

Mr X is a Congolese man who was living in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. In early June 2006, he lost his passport. He went to the Tanzanian police to register the loss of his passport and to the DRC embassy to request for a new passport. But on 9 June 2006, Tanzanian authorities arrested him, his wife and their two sons for residing illegally in the country – despite the fact that he presented the certificate of loss of his passport, which contained a visa to stay in the country until September 2006, and the official correspondence from the embassy of his country to Tanzania confirming that he was in the process of obtaining a new passport. Mr X was brought to prison along with his family. Upon arrival, he was subjected to an anal search in front of his children, and they were all put in cells. They were detained for 5 days before being released, thanks to the intervention of the DRC embassy. His family was ordered to leave the country just a few days later while he was allowed to stay in Tanzania during judicial proceedings to determine whether he is an illegal immigrant. Seven years later, after matter concluded before Tanzanian courts, he was ordered to leave Tanzania too. Having no other available legal avenue left, he submitted a complaint to the African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights in 2015. On 28 March 2019, the African Court found that Tanzania had violated Mr X’s rights on multiple levels – rights to dignity and physical integrity, right to residence and freedom of movement, and right to a fair trial.¹ The Court said that Tanzanian authorities should not have arrested him in the first place as he was legally present in the country. In addition, his dignity was violated as he was subjected to the degrading treatment of the anal search upon entry into the prison. The Court added that he was not a security threat as he was only accused of not having his passport and, even assuming there was a need for anal search, the State agents should not have conducted it in the presence of his children. Thereafter, Tanzanian courts also failed to try him within a reasonable time given that it took many years for it to decide whether he was to be deported. The Court ordered Tanzania to pay compensation to Mr X, his wife and his children for the psychological suffering they endured over the years and to take all necessary measures to change their practice with regards to systematic anal search – to ensure that, if conducted at all, they are at least conducted in a manner that is respectful of the person’s integrity, dignity, reputation and honour. This judgment has therefore recognized that what Mr X went through was wrong and provided some remedy to him and his family, but it also has the potential to change the experience of all people being arrested and brought to prison in Tanzania, to make sure they are treated in a more humane manner.

0,Ogiek case: protection of an indigenous community in Kenya,AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2023/06/ogiek-case-protection-of-an-indigenous-community-in-kenya/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? In Kenya, the Mau forest is the ancestral home of an indigenous community called the Ogiek people. The Ogiek community comprises 20,000 members, about 15,000 of whom inhabit the greater Mau Forest Complex, a land mass of about 400,000 hectares. The Ogieks are divided into clans, they have their own language and their own social norms and forms of subsistence. As a hunter-gatherer community, the Ogiek have for centuries depended on the Mau Forest for their residence and as a source of livelihood. But in October 2009, the Kenya Forestry Service ordered the eviction of the Ogiek community from the Mau Forest within 30 days. The Kenyan government knew that the Ogieks had occupied lands in the Mau Forest since time immemorial, however they refused to recognize them as an indigenous population that needed to be protected. The following month, the Centre for Minority Rights Developments (CEMIRIDE) and Minority Rights Group International (MRGI), two NGOs acting on behalf of the Ogiek community of the Mau Forest, submitted a complaint to the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights, which in turn transferred the case to the African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights in 2012. After the African Court was seized, it ordered the Kenyan government to immediately reinstate the restrictions it had imposed on land transactions in the Mau Forest complex as a provisional measure, to prevent the Ogiek people from further irreparable harm while the case was being examined. On 26 May 2017, the Court reached a decision on the matter and found that Kenya had violated the Ogiek community’s rights.¹ The Court said that Kenyan authorities should not have expelled the Ogieks from their ancestral lands against their will and should not have deprived them of disposing of the food produced by these lands. In doing so, they violated their right to land and their right to disposing of the wealth and natural resources of their land. Also, the judges recognized that the evictions rendered it impossible for the Ogieks to continue their religious practices which are all linked to religious sites in the Mau Forest, and it greatly affected their ability to continue their traditions. On top of that, Kenya had not recognized the Ogiek as an indigenous community whereas they recognized other distinct communities such as the Maasai, and they had denied them special protection available to these other communities. The state had therefore discriminated the Ogiek and denied their rights to freely exercise their religion and their culture. On 23 June 2022, the Court further ordered Kenya to pay compensation to the Ogiek for the material and moral prejudice they suffered, as well as to take all necessary measures, legislative and otherwise, to identify, delimit and title Ogiek ancestral land and to grant them collective title to such land. Where concessions or leases have already been granted over parts of this land, the Court ordered Kenyan authorities to commence consultation between the Ogiek and the other concerned parties in order to reach an agreement on returning such land or continuing their operations by way of lease or royalty and benefit sharing with the Ogiek. The Court also ordered Kenya to guarantee full recognition of the Ogiek as an indigenous people of Kenya and to take all measures to protect the right of the Ogiek to be effectively consulted in respect of all development, conservation or investment projects on its land. After years of struggle with the national authorities, the Ogiek were finally recognized as an indigenous community, having rights on the Mau forest and which religious and cultural specificities must be protected. For the NGOs that brought the case and for many observers, this is a historic case, which brings a “beacon of hope” for the advancement of rights of indigenous people or other minorities in Kenya and more broadly.

We don’t grow as many tomatoes and bitter tomatoes as a result. We believe the smell of the factory which processes fish, attracts the flies […] which stand on tomatoes putting something on […] we think it’s eggs. Habibatou, a woman probably in her fifties wearing a long fuchsia dress, spoke to Amnesty International as she carried on working, drawing water from the well, hurrying to water her plants. She had little time to spare to stop and talk – there are more mouths to feed in her home now that her daughter and her children have moved back in following her son-in-law’s death. Like many women in Sanyang, in the West Coast Region of Gambia, Habibatou works cultivating the land near to the beach area. Most of the women have been working there for more than 20 years, growing cabbages, tomatoes, rice and cucumbers to pay for their children’s school fees. She described how, one day back in 2017, as the women arrived at the gardens, they saw bulldozers destroying the community rice fields. A few weeks later, construction began on a fishmeal factory. None of the women Amnesty International spoke to had been informed or consulted about the arrival of factory; most negotiations, including the ones about compensation, were carried out without them. No one told us the factory will be there […] This factory is not good. The smell affects our health and then we will not be able to work. They sold the place without giving us notice. The factory is one of three fishmeal and fish oil factories in Gambia. These factories transform pelagic fish into fish oil or a powder called fishmeal, which is then used to feed farm animals and other fish, like salmon, in the aquaculture industry, usually in Europe, Asia and the Americas. It takes about 4.5kg of fish to make 1kg of fishmeal. Fish oil is also used to make food supplement capsules. The land on which Habibatou and others had used to grow crops is now the site of a factory of Nessim Fishing and Fish Processing Co. Ltd, a Mauritanian-owned company, the last of the three such factories to be opened in Gambia. The women now work cultivating the remainder of the gardens around the perimeter of the factory. Habibatou described how, in addition to the land lost, the gardens around the fishmeal factory have been seriously affected. She complained that since the factory arrived, she has noticed that her plants produce less fruit and that the harvest is smaller, so her income has gradually declined. She is convinced that the smoke and the smell coming from the factory also affect both the quality of her plants and her well-being. She has had to use more pesticides to try to control the increasing number of flies, which she and the other women attribute to the smell coming from the factory. The flies lay eggs on her tomatoes and infect them with pests. The cost of the pesticides on top of the lost crops has reduced profit margins even further. Without effective government action to address the environmental degradation engulfing the area, Habibatou’s future looks bleak, and that of her children and grandchildren bleaker still.  * A pseudonym has been used to protect the interviewee’s security and privacy Listening to the voices of Sanyang and the stories of suffering from members of the community, it is hard to understand why the Gambian authorities are failing to act to defend the human rights of the people affected by the fishmeal factory and foreign trawlers. Clearly, the voices of those championing the benefits of profits are louder and stronger – but the profits are not reaching the people paying the price for mass exploitation of Gambia’s coastal waters. No matter who shouts loudest, the Gambian authorities have responsibilities that they must fulfil – including ensuring the rights of the population to food, work, health and a safe environment. The Gambian government has a duty to protect these rights and pass legislation requiring companies to conduct human rights due diligence in their operations and supply chains and ensure proper monitoring of Gambia’s waters. It also has an obligation to ensure transparency and allow easy public access to information about fishmeal factories and foreign trawlers and investigate the possible detrimental impact of their operations. The Nessim fishmeal factory must be transparent about its activities, regularly consult with the community and follow the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, including by putting in place an ongoing and proactive human rights due diligence process to identify, prevent, mitigate and address the factory’s impact on human rights. Given the potential high economic and environmental impact of its activities, it must phase out the use of fish that according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization are already overexploited, such as sardinella and bonga fish. Companies in the supply chain of fishmeal factories also have a role to play. They need to conduct supply chain due diligence and publicly disclose their due diligence policies and practices, in accordance with international standards, and take action, in cooperation with other relevant actors, to mitigate or remediate any harm caused. Responsibilities for the situation also lie further afield. The international community, including countries that have signed fishing agreements with Gambia, need to regulate the aquaculture industry to limit the use of fishmeal and fish oil made from already overexploited species and increase transparency regarding their supply chain. They cannot carry on closing their eyes and ears because the sights and smells of Sanyang are far from them – out of sight must not mean out of mind. Join Amnesty International members and supporters in their campaign to protect Gambia’s coastal waters, marine resources and communities. Act now by emailing the President of Gambia, Adama Barrow, to demand that he ensures the implementation of Amnesty International’s recommendations.   The members of the communities affected by the overexploitation of the seas through the activities of Nessim Fishmeal Factory and foreign industrial trawlers are sharing their stories with us.

On 9 June 1998, African States meeting in Burkina Faso created the African Court by adopting the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights on the Establishment of an African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights. The Protocol came into force on 25 January 2004 after it was ratified by more than 15 countries. It took a few years before the African Court became fully functional. The African Court is based in Arusha, Tanzania and is composed of 11 judges from all over the continent. The first judges were appointed in 2006 and the Court was finally able to receive its first complaints in 2010. The Court’s mission is to protect, promote and defend human rights enshrined in the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights, the main human rights instrument on the African continent. It does so by interpreting the provisions of the Charter and by judging African States which have allegedly violated these rights. As of March 2023, 34 States out of the 55 African Union Member States are States Parties to the Protocol establishing the Court. The African Court carries out its mission to protect, promote and defend human rights by interpreting and applying the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights, as well as the Protocol establishing the Court and any other relevant human rights instruments ratified by the concerned State(s).

The Court may receive complaints against one or several State(s) alleging that the(se) State(s) has/have violated the rights of one or several persons, or a community, or a population. When that happens, the Court will analyse the case taking into account arguments by the complainant(s), the concerned State(s) and sometimes other interveners. The Court will thereafter render a judgment explaining how and why there was, or there was not, a human rights violation. In case of violation, the Court will also order the State to take specific measures to remedy the situation, such as changing the law or paying compensation to the persons who suffered the human rights violation. This is what is called the contentious jurisdiction of the Court. [check out examples] The Court may receive requests for advisory opinions. These requests are questions submitted to the judges on any legal matter relating to the African Charter or other relevant human rights instruments. Upon receiving such request, the Court will analyse the question and will then issue an advisory opinion to give guidance to States on how to interpret or apply the law with regards to the concerned question. Although these opinions do not target any State in particular, they may lead to practical changes with a wide impact on the continent. This is what is called the advisory role of the Court. For individuals and NGOs to be able to directly submit complaints to the African Court, the concerned State(s) must have allowed them to do so. The ratification of the Protocol establishing the Court does not by itself open the possibility for people to seek redress before the African Court against a State. Only other States and the African Commission would be able to bring a case against such State, which rarely happens. However, individuals and NGOs can directly access the African Court if the concerned State makes a declaration under article 34(6) allowing such direct access in addition to ratifying the Protocol establishing the Court. As of March 2023, only 8 States out of the 34 States which have ratified the Protocol (and out of the 55 African Union member states) have deposited a “34(6) declaration” allowing individuals and NGOs to bring complaints to the Court: Burkina Faso, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Malawi, Niger and Tunisia.

Importantly, the individual or the NGO who wishes to go before the African Court must ensure that they have already exhausted local remedies. Indeed, the African Court is a court of last resort. This means that they must first try to get justice before the courts of their own country, including appealing judgments and going all the way up to the highest national court when it is possible. It is only if they believe that their national courts failed to address the injustice they suffered that they can access the African Court. Other admissibility requirements are laid out in article 56 of the African Charter. In short, the complaint must: Exhaust all remedies before the courts of your own country first Make sure your case is not before another international court Then submit the complaint to the African court within a reasonable delay Indicate who you are Do not use disparaging or insulting language Do not base your complaint solely on news from the media The Court meets at least four times a year. They are called the ordinary sessions of the Court and they are usually held in March, June, September and December. Each session lasts for about 4 weeks. During these sessions, judges discuss arguments presented to them, sometimes they convene hearings to hear additional arguments orally, and they deliberate. Each session concludes with the delivery of judgments in several cases. The Court can decide to meet more often, in sessions which are referred to as extraordinary sessions. These would be held for instance when there is an urgent matter to decide on or when there is a particular backlog of cases. The number of complaints received and dealt with by the Court varies from year to year. As of March 2023, according to the Court, it had received 330 complaints, among which 172 have been decided and 158 are still pending, and 15 requests for advisory opinions which have all been determined. Among the 172 finalized cases, half of them were actually dismissed by the judges because the complaints did not fulfil the admissibility requirements and half of them were cases examined on their merits by the Court. Overall, the Court found States responsible for human rights violations in over 60 cases, on issues such as the right to a fair trial, the right to freedom of expression, the right not to be discriminated against, the right not to be treated in an inhumane or degrading manner, the right to participate in the political life of one’s country, the right to work, and so on. [check out examples] Although a majority of States has ratified the Protocol establishing the African Court, the low number of States which have also deposited the 34(6) declaration allowing individuals and NGOs to directly access the Court is a major challenge. It considerably limits the jurisdiction of the Court and therefore its ability to efficiently protect human rights everywhere on the continent. As of March 2023, only 8 States out of the 34 States parties to the Protocol (and out of the 55 African Union member states) had deposited a “34(6) declaration” allowing individuals and NGOs to bring complaints to the Court: Burkina Faso, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Malawi, Niger and Tunisia. Another challenge is the low implementation of the African Court’s decisions. Unfortunately, in many situations, States have delayed putting in place measures that were ordered by the Court to remedy human rights violations. The African Union political bodies have not been proactive enough in ensuring that Court’s judgments, binding in nature, are promptly followed by State actions. Some States unfortunately went as far as withdrawing their 34(6) declarations in reaction to Court’s decisions that displeased them. Rwanda withdrew its 34(6) declaration in 2016, Tanzania in 2019, and Benin and Cote d’Ivoire in 2020. These attacks to the Court itself were real steps backwards for the protection of human rights on the continent and for the concerned people who were deprived of a justice avenue that they had already been granted. Hopefully the future trend will on the contrary show more and more States valuing the building of a strong African human rights system. The African Court and the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights, also known as the “Banjul Commission”, are complementary. They are two separate bodies of the African Union both tasked with protecting and promoting human rights in Africa. The Commission monitors States’ implementation of the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights and develops human rights standards. It has a quasi-judicial function, meaning it can receive complaints from individuals and give recommendations to States on specific cases. The African Court was created to complement and reinforce the quasi-judicial function of the Commission. Unlike the Commission, the Court is a judicial body which can receive complaints on alleged violations of the Charter and issues decisions which are binding on States. The manner in which the complementarity of the two institutions works in practice is developed in the Protocol establishing the Court and the Rules of the Court. The Commission may transfer a case to the Court on its own initiative. The Court may hear the Commission in the course of examining a case, as a party to the case when the complaint was submitted to the Court by the Commission or also as an expert (referred to as “amicus curiae”, literally “friend of the Court”) in all other cases. The Court also has the possibility to request the Commission to travel to a State and conduct certain investigations when it is needed for an ongoing case. Finally, the Court has the power to review the decision of the Commission in a particular case. All African States should respect, protect and promote rights enshrined in the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights; All African Union member states should ratify the Protocol establishing the African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights; All African Union member states should deposit the declaration under article 34(6) of the Protocol allowing individuals and NGOs to directly access the African Court If you are talented and passionate about human rights then Amnesty International wants to hear from you. © 2024 Amnesty International","['\nAfrica\n', '\nCampaigns\n', '\nStory\n']",,False

This popular tourism spot is also the centre of one of Gambia’s other main sources of income – fish. I smell the factory since I arrived here. I smell them every time they start working. The smell bothers me. Adja, a widow in her forties, said she had begun smoking fish four months earlier following her husband’s death in order to support herself and her five children, aged between 10 and seven months. But the work is hard and the income precarious. Adja smokes mainly bonga and sardinella fish, but massive fishing by the factory canoes and foreign trawlers means fish are becoming scarcer and more expensive – and that means her profit is both unstable and shrinking.  There are weeks when she manages to earn 300 dalasi (around 5 euros) but some weeks, after paying for the wood and fish and the rent on the smoking place, she is left with barely anything to take home. As she told us this, two things were constant – the smile on her face and her total determination to carry on and not lose hope of a better future for herself and for her children. I still have hope […] I will see whether I can keep doing this. From the past four months, I have not seen any positive change; the situation is getting worse, there are not enough fish.” However, Adja and thousands more like her face daunting odds in trying to protect her family, community and environment. Women make up about 80% of fish processors and 50% of small-scale fish traders – all of whom are undoubtedly affected by the shortage of fish and environmental degradation. The cause of that deterioration in standards of living and the environment is a stark demonstration of how lives are being negatively impacted by human activities, often far away, that are failing to take into account their effect on the resources we all ultimately depend on. Excessive fishing is a human-led activity that destroys and empties our seas. The life of the communities that used to live in symbiosis with the sea and marine life are being destroyed at an unquantifiable scale and alarming speed. Gambia lies on the West Coast of Africa and has a coastline of approximately 80 km. Fishing is a core activity for many Gambians and a key source of food for its population, especially pelagic fishes (fish living near the ocean’s surface) such as sardinella or bonga. Excessive fishing by big foreign trawlers and fishmeal and fish oil factories has emptied the Gambian coast of fish at a frenetic pace. Gambia exports almost 20,000 tonnes of fish annually through the activities of fishmeal factories, foreign industrial vessels and fish processors. Adding to that, the country, together with Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Mauritania, Senegal and Sierra Leone, lose about US$2.3 billion annually to illegal fishing. The picture is grim.  This overfishing is not sustainable – both in terms of the overall health of the oceans and the human population.  Right now, the most severe immediate impact is being felt by the people of Sanyang. They know that, in the long term, this overexploitation of their sea, by the big foreign trawlers and the fishmeal factories, is harming their lives and their environment. They told Amnesty International of their concern about the larger impact all this will have on their community; the increased prices of an important staple of their diet, the rise of unemployment among people that live from traditional fishing and the growing food insecurity in a population for whom fish is an essential source of protein.  According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, between 2015 and 2020, the number of people affected by food insecurity increased from 5 to 8% in Gambia. The Gambian government has an obligation to protect its people and to defend their fundamental human rights including the rights to food, decent work, health and a safe environment. However, the experiences of Adja and others who spoke to Amnesty International show that far from defending these rights, it is allowing them to be eroded in the name of limited economic interests. The Gambian government must protect these rights and pass legislation requiring companies to conduct human rights due diligence in their operations and supply chains and ensure proper monitoring of Gambia waters against illegal fishing. The government must also show transparency and allow easy public access to information about fishmeal factories and foreign trawlers.  Join Amnesty International members and supporters in their campaign to protect Gambia’s coastal waters, marine resources and communities. Act now by emailing the President of Gambia, Adama Barrow, to demand that he ensures the implementation of Amnesty International’s recommendations.  * A pseudonym has been used to protect the interviewee’s security and privacy.

Zambia is a land-locked country in southern Africa and remains the world’s seventh-largest producer of copper, along with strategic minerals like cobalt, nickel, and manganese. Despite this endowment, along with agriculture and wildlife, 54.7% of the population lives in poverty – the average for sub-Saharan Africa is 40%. The advent of Covid-19 undermined trade and exacerbated inequality.     The majority of Zambia’s debt was written off by 2005 under the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank’s Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative. The country began to accumulate new debt from 2012 onwards, following the advice of the IMF, World Bank, and regional financial institutions, and a forecasted increase in the price of copper. Zambia borrowed short-term loans to finance infrastructure projects such as building bridges, highways, and hospitals. These projects, however, took longer than the repayment timeframe to return revenue and socioeconomic value. Copper prices failing to reach estimated highs; and COVID-19 emergence in 2020, along with an ongoing climate crisis, meant Zambia faced severe challenges in paying back its loans. Between 2018 and 2021, debt repayments increased from 20% to 38% of the country’s national budget, just as the allocation of funds towards the health sector declined from 9.5% in 2018 to 8% in 2022. This reflects shrinking fiscal space, with lower allocations to other priorities such as education (which dropped from 17.2% in 2016 to 12.4% in 2022), and a growing debt-servicing bill. In November 2020 Zambia became the first African country to default on its foreign debt during the Covid-19 pandemic. Since then, it has signed a USD 1.3 billion loan from the IMF – with stringent conditions- and entered debt-restructuring talks with other creditors. Under the IMF agreement, Zambia must implement austerity measures, which include eliminating fuel subsidies and ‘inefficient public investments to reduce the primary balance[1] deficit from 6% of GDP to a 3.2% surplus by 2025. Revenue gains are expected to be made by cutting electricity subsidies, raising tariffs, and expanding value-added tax (sales tax) to more goods. These conditions, the IMF argues, will be balanced by higher spending on social protection (including health services). Additionally, Zambia’s external debt payments are expected to decrease from USD 3.1 billion in 2022 to USD 1.1 billion in 2023 if successful debt restructuring negotiations with other creditors take place. In theory, this means Zambia will have more funds to spend on social services, as shown in Zambia’s 2023 budget plans, where health receives a 25% increase this year. While the IMF claims a large portion of the money will be directed toward education, health, and social protection, significant improvement in health services requires continuous investment by government. A one-off investment through a loan may not have a long-term impact on the quality of and access to health services as the country is likely to revert to pre-loan spending levels once the loan is exhausted and payments become due. In addition, loan conditionality and austerity measures are typically regressive in nature, having a disproportionate impact on the most vulnerable members of society further significantly impacting health access. For example, the elimination of fuel subsidies could make transport for people in remote areas more costly, thereby reducing access to health centers. Similarly, increases in electricity tariffs can lead to higher costs for hospitals and clinics trying to provide uninterrupted care, as well as households choosing between food, electricity, and medicine. This will tend to have a disproportionate impact on poorer consumers who pay a larger amount of their household income towards these goods. These potential concerns are exacerbated by Zambia’s tendency to underspend on budget allocations to health. According to UNICEF, underspending increased from 8% in 2015 to 26.7% in 2020. This happened in conjunction with a worsening economy, and rising debt service costs. Therefore, it is critical that the government improve its budget credibility – in forecasting, allocation, and implementation, and that it is subject to the scrutiny of parliament, independent auditing bodies, civil society, and the public. Zambia is resource-rich but loses income through double taxation agreements (DTAs), including from dividends, royalties, and technical fees for companies with subsidiaries in both Zambia and other countries. It also offers preferential corporate tax incentives increasing reliance on employees paying tax to boost government revenue. This dependence on personal income taxes over corporate income taxes worsened in 2022 when the Zambia Revenue Authority reduced the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 30%. Furthermore, it is estimated that Zambia loses over USD 4.5 billion annually through tax evasion and tax avoidance. Tax justice organizations have called for cost-benefit analyses on tax expenditures and lost revenue to be carried out and made public, and for DTAs to go through parliamentary approval to enable more public scrutiny. By promoting and prioritizing domestic resource mobilization over austerity as it’s obliged to do under international human rights law, Zambia could better enable the continuous and progressive realization of socioeconomic rights, and in time even reduce its reliance on external financing from loans and aid.     Under international law, Zambia is required to ensure healthcare services are of good quality and available to all without discrimination. An integral part of implementing this means the government needs to allocate and spend adequate resources in the healthcare sector to meet the needs of the population. Zambia’s health spending, budgeted and actual, averaged 8.8% of the budget between 2015 and 2022. This falls well short of the Abuja Declaration’s target of 15%. A more comprehensive approach is needed. While IMF loans and debt restructuring can have some short-term positive impact on the availability of resources, the accompanying austerity measures will most likely negatively affect healthcare access for vulnerable populations. There is also the concern that other creditors will fail to come to the party on debt negotiations. The Zambian government’s commitment to healthcare financing is positive, but both budget credibility and implementation is lacking. In addition to the need for tax reform, and a reduced reliance on external funding, Zambia and its creditors must consider options that support long-term, inclusive development, climate resilience and strengthen the provision of healthcare and social protection for its people.

A year later, we have used this crowdsourced data to develop an advocacy and awareness online tool that demonstrates our research findings and makes the data explorable. The open data generated has been used to analyse the relationship between race, space and surveillance, and to expose the ways in which the public square is threatened as a site of protest, particularly for communities of colour. But what else can we glean from this? How can surveillance data generated by activists––in conversation with existing open data sets––help us reclaim our cities? How can we use open data, centred around geography and demographics in particular, help us in the fight against AI-driven surveillance? Amnesty International Researcher/Adviser – Big Data, Artificial Intelligence & Human Rights June 8, 2023 | 9 – 10pm BST In the ‘Digital Decade’, the European Union (EU)’s main objective was to regulate some of the most salient aspects of the digital transformation. Another objective was to inspire the relevant legislation of other states in the international community. In many instances, enforcement contributes to the strengthening of the protection of online freedom of expression and other basic rights. However, in others, the application may lead to the deepening of existing asymmetries. This session will focus in particular on the footprint of key texts for content moderation on social media, and its intended and unintended impacts, as well issues of privacy. This session aims to become an exercise in collective imagination and foresight around current issues that intertwine global problems (conflicts, violence, exploitation) and the impact of regulation on the digital sphere. 7amleh Alia Al Ghussain (Amnesty International), Nighat Dad (Digital Rights Foundation), Itxaso Domínguez de Olazábal (7amleh), Tomiwa Ilori (University of Pretoria), Nadim Nashif (7amleh) Researcher/Adviser – Big Tech Accountability Every year, our global community comes together to fight injustice and support people whose human rights are under threat.

0,How does public debt affect the right to health: Case studies in East and Southern Africa,AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2023/05/how-does-public-debt-affect-the-right-to-health-case-studies-in-east-and-southern-africa/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? The implication of debt on human rights is becoming an increasingly significant concern – especially in the Eastern and Southern Africa region. Many countries in the region are either already in a debt crisis or approaching debt distress. This is not a new phenomenon for the region, as 15 of the 25 countries in East and Southern Africa were part of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries initiative. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the ability of many countries to both service debt and meet the increasing health needs of their citizens.  Research shows that some governments in the region chose to borrow more funds to support at-risk groups and build health infrastructure to respond to the pandemic. With the emergence of increased investment interest in the region from governments, corporations and individuals – particularly in the natural resource sector – public debt on the continent is now owned by an array of different lenders in addition to the traditional multi-lateral development institutions. This makes it more challenging for creditors to reach consensus on debt restructuring or cancellation. So why is debt a problem?  It is not necessarily the size of the ratio of debt to GDP that represents the risk to a country’s fiscal sustainability. Rather, one needs to consider what tax revenues, savings, and reserve levels a country has. This indicates whether a government can fund a call on the debt and maintain confidence from creditors. Secondly, where there is limited manoeuvrability in a country’s budget to address spending needs and crises- as is the case with many African countries – the pace of growth of debt interest costs and repayments, in comparison to other budget items like health and education, becomes critical. During the pandemic, at least 29 African countries faced this tough choice and were pushed to join the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) offered by the Group of 20 (G20). The DSSI was designed specifically to provide countries like Zambia, Malawi, and Uganda additional flexibility in their budgets to provide for health, social and economic needs in response to the COVID-19 crisis. In reality, however, the DSSI faced criticism on the lack of participation by corporate and individual creditors, and that it was only a temporary break from interest and repayments – providing no solution for long-term debt obligations and the worsening economic context of countries. Covid-19 had a marked impact on the provision of health services in African countries, with the perfect storm of declining tax revenues, increasing debt repayments, and rising expenditure demands. In particular, the focus on COVID-19 has often been at the expense of other health concerns, such as sexual reproductive health, malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV. Lockdown protocols also likely further exacerbated the disparities in health equity between rural and urban areas. This is against a historical backdrop of existing health services often failing to meet the universal human rights standards of availability, accessibility, acceptability, and quality. The UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has stated that states are obliged to respect, fulfil, and protect the right to health. This right is guaranteed under various international and regional treaties that African states have ratified, including Article 12 of the International Covenant on Social, Economic and Cultural Rights, which obliges states to ensure the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. Implementation of these obligations, however, has been hindered by budgetary constraints, alleged corruption, and a lack of political will to prioritize health, even in countries like Malawi, Zambia, Uganda, and Burundi that have ratified these agreements. While State parties are obligated to provide adequate, affordable, and accessible health services, with the Abuja Declaration requiring the allocation of 15% of the budget to health, very few African countries have ever met this 15% commitment, spending much more of their revenue on debt servicing, especially in recent years. In cases where countries have been able to meet the spending requirement, a closer look at their books may indicate that the focus is not necessarily on primary healthcare. In this blog series, we will examine the state of debt and its impact on the right to health in four countries – Malawi, Burundi, Zambia, and Uganda. We will analyze the challenges faced by these countries in meeting their obligations in terms of the right to health, particularly in the context of debt, and provide recommendations on better ways to address debt while still meeting their health obligations. By doing so, we hope to shed light on the urgent need to prioritize health equity in African countries and ensure the universal realization of the right to health for all.

0,A two-tracks road to justice for Sierra Leoneans killed in August 2022 violence,AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2023/04/a-two-tracks-road-to-justice-for-sierra-leoneans-killed-in-august-2022-violence/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? The families of people killed during protests in August 2022 in Sierra Leone deserve justice too. As the world continued to grapple with the economic impacts of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, in August 2022, Sierra Leone erupted into violent events, leaving some cities in the country, including the capital Freetown, in turmoil. The escalation of violence has been attributed to several factors, including political dissatisfaction with government policies and economic hardship. The government’s decision to increase the price of fuel by more than 20% was one of the catalysts of the wave of protests on August 10. The authorities’ response to the demonstrations was to impose a national curfew, with the deployment of the military on the streets. They were multiple allegations of excessive use of force against protesters. Some protests escalated into violence, with looting shops, and burning down buildings in a few cities. The situation quickly spiraled out of control, with reports of police officers being killed and using excessive force. As a result, six police officers and more than 20 protesters and bystanders were killed in Freetown, Makeni and Kamakwie. They offered to give us 20 million Leones ($1,016) as compensation following his death, but we refused to take them. We only seek justice for him.   Despite the country’s vast natural resources, Sierra Leone is one of the poorest countries in the world. According to its Human Development Index, it is ranked 181 over a total of 191 countries. It is also one of the countries with the lowest levels of investment in social protection, allocating just a 0.7% of GDP to social protection expenditures (excluding healthcare). In the days following the protests, the authorities held a meeting with the bereaved families during which they informed them that the government would take care of the burial for security reasons. The bodies of the victims were withheld from their families for at least two months before a mass burial was held. I am Joseph, the father of Fatmata Lam Conteh who was tragically shot and killed at Dove Cut market in Freetown. Fatmata was the eldest of my seven children. She was a hardworker. On 10 August, Fatmata went to sell vegetable leaves as she normally did. She arrived at the market around 6:30 am to begin her workday. She didn’t take part in the protests that took place at and around the market, but unfortunately, she was shot and rushed to Connaught Hospital where she passed away later that day. We were devastated upon learning of her death. When I attempted to see her remains at the mortuary the hospital administration denied my request due to the growing tense political situation following the protests. It took over a week before I was finally granted access to see my daughter’s body during the post-mortem examination. The coroner concluded that she was shot in her leg and in her back around the lower spinal cord. The government granted a compensation package of twenty million Leones ($1,016) to each bereaved family member. However, some families did not accept it, believing that the government was provoking them. The Minister of Internal Affairs, Mr. David Maurice Panda-Noah, refused our request to take the bodies of our loved ones to bury them, citing security reasons. The government took responsibility for the burial, which took place on 10 October 2022 at Bolima Cemetery which is where people who died from Ebola are buried. During the burial, confusion ensued between security personnel and some members of the bereaved families as they were not allowed to bid final farewell to their loved ones. But later in the evening, I was informed that I could go and see my daughter final resting place. I was given her grave number which is 04. There were 26 other graves next to hers. The authorities claimed it was a crossfire, but the evidence is telling a different story. He was shot at the back of his leg while he was fleeing. I am originally from Makeni, but I am now living and working in Freetown. On 14 August, I received a call from one of our tenants in Makeni who informed me that my brother, Samson, had been killed. I was shocked and confused by the news. She explained that he was killed in Makeni and sent me photos. I immediately called my mom to confirm the news, but no one was clear about the details. All they knew for sure was that he was taken to Freetown. I spent the whole night trying to find out where his corpse was but to no avail. The next morning, I went to different places in the hope to find him. Late that evening, I received a call confirming that Samson’s body was brought at Connaught Mortuary. On 16 August, I went to Connaught Mortuary. They confirmed that they had received a body from Makeni, but the name of the person was unknown. I showed them a photo of Samson, and they confirmed that it was him. I informed our family in Makeni. When I asked if I could take the body for burial, they said that they didn’t have the mandate to allow me to do so and referred me to the Ministry of Internal Affairs. But the ministry  made us wait a whole month without answers while a lawyer, who accepted to represent us for free, tried in vain to secure a meeting. On 24 September, we finally were called in for the post-mortem examination. The pathologist walked us through the process and concluded that although Samson had no visible head injuries, he had been shot in the back and the bullet that had hit his thigh bone, had caused it to shatter. Samson died from the blood loss. We were not able to claim Samson’s body. He was buried with the 26 other bodies during a mass burial that was a unilateral decision from the government. During the burial, we were prevented from being in proximity to the graves and had to remain at least five meters away from them. Samson was a 36-year-old loving father and husband. He had a son who is less than two years old. He was killed on 14 August, after the events of 10 August because he was targeted for his political affiliations. The authorities claimed it was a crossfire, but the evidence is telling a different story. He was shot at the back of his leg while he was fleeing. There is no evidence that people that were with him were armed.  He was our family’s pillar and was particularly close to our mom. She’s still traumatized by his death and the way things were handled afterwards. They offered to give us 20 million Leones ($1,016) as compensation following his death but we refused to take them. We only seek justice for him. Three police officers died in Freetown on 10 August. One other who was injured that day, later died from his injuries. One died in Makeni and two in Kamakwye. In total, seven died in relation to policing the 10 August events. According to William Fayia Sellu Inspector General of Police, the first police officer who died was killed around 11:00 am. In response, police started using tear gas on protesters and at that time there were no death of protesters to report. Around 11:30 am, Abu Bakarr Turay who a police officer for more than 12 years was brutally murdered in Makeni. He was coming to duty on a motorbike. He was late because he just finished a night shift few hours ago. He met an angry crowd. He was alone and was attacked with sticks and stones. At 12pm, another police officer was attacked in Brima Lane in Freetown. In Kissy Road, two other officers were shot: one in the neck and the other in the back. On the Easter part of Freetown, two police officers were violently beaten and were rescued by security forces. One died a few months later while the other is still hospitalised. A state funeral was held thirteen days after the 10 August events with the presence of the President Julius Maada Bio who expressed his solidarity and his commitment to justice for the families of the police officers who died while protecting their nation. The ceremony was live streamed on social media and TV channels. Many officials were present at the Hastings Police Training School in Freetown where they honoured the fallen. The Sierra Leonean flag was put on their coffins. Officials lay flowers for them, and speeches were made to express anger, solicitude, and determination towards justice for the families. Each of the bereaved family of the police officers received 100 million Leones ($5081). The six police officers were named Superintendent Osman Fofanah, Sergeant Tommy Munda, Constable Abu Bakarr Turay, Sergeant Desmond Hanciles, Constable Charles E.K. Smart and Sergeant Ibrahim Jalloh. 515 people were arrested in total. Some of them were arrested later because there was evidence against them. A total of 515 people were arrested in connection to the 10 August protests, with around 200 of them arrested for violating the curfew. Some people were arrested later based on evidence against them. Charges against protesters ranged from malicious damage, arson, unlawful procession, riotous conduct, seditious behaviour to murder. Arrests were also made for the killing of police officers in the days following the events. However, no investigation has been initiated into the killings of protesters. The authorities launched a Special Investigation Committee the day following the burial of the six police officers who died on 10 August. That committee concluded on 24 April 2023 that it could not ascertain the veracity of allegations of unlawful killings. No arrests were made in relation to killings of protesters and no investigation is ongoing on any of the more than 20 deaths. On 10 August, we went on the streets to protest and tell the world about the economic hardship we were facing. I was in Makeni around Kabala highway by the cemetery. The Security forces started using tear gas on us and as the crowds increased, they started using live bullets. I was very closed when one of the protesters received a bullet in the chest. He was shot from about 15 feet (four to five metres). I was arrested by soldiers and handed over to the police. The soldiers used the butts of their guns, belts, and protective helmets to hit me all over my body. They then put me inside a police Land Cruiser. From inside the vehicle, I saw both police and military shooting at people. There were eight protesters, including me, in the vehicle. We were all male. We were then taken to Rogbaneh police station and put in a cell with others. Whilst there, they brought about 70 other people. I saw many women among them. The group also included juveniles. We spent a day in the cell, and the next day, we were beaten and transported to Freetown. We were taken to Jui police station and stayed there until the next morning. On Friday 12 August, we were taken to CID headquarters. There were 17 men, and they were taunting us saying: “who sent you to demonstrate? You should pray, only God can save you.”. They told us that anyone who spoke about this to anyone would be killed. They threatened us. We were then taken to the special court building for safekeeping. We were transferred to the prison inside the special court, and there were 43 people in my cell, with about 30 of them being protesters. The cell was small, and there was not enough room. The mattresses were light foam mattresses. We could all lie down to sleep, but it was very congested. The toilet was in the cell and was open, so you could see people using it. It was one toilet for 43 men but at least it had working water. They were giving us food too, but it was not hygienic. We had food every day. Our movements were restricted, and we were released every day for only 10 minutes to walk outside the cells, except on Sundays. I was in prison for a month and 25 days without being interrogated. When we were arrested, they told us we were arrested for protesting, for killing an officer, for destroying shops, burning cars. They read the charges to us only after a month and weeks had passed. We were sent to court and 27 of us were condemned and sent to Pademba Road Prison. We were 43 to be sent back to CID headquarters. We spent a day there and then we were released. The experience was traumatic and one I hope never to repeat.

My name is Abril and I am a 17 year old child activist and human rights defender from Argentina. I am part of the Youth group of Amnesty International Argentina. I also volunteer as part of the Youth Agents of Change programme of Ashoka Conosur. I participate as a counsellor in the public ministry of the government of the city of Buenos Aires and am a content creator for UNICEF and part of its youth network Voices of Youth. Today, on 10 March 2023, I am in Geneva at the United Nations Human Rights Council to mark the Annual Day on the Rights of the Child. This year the focus is on our rights in the digital environment. It is important that the voices and experiences of children and young people are listened to and that we are included in discussions about our rights. This is why today in the Human Rights Council chamber, Amnesty International gave me their speaking slot so as a child I can speak directly to decision-makers and share my experiences and concerns. I am passionate about the digital rights of children and young people, especially keeping us safe online and protecting our health and well-being in the digital environment. My hope for the future is that child and youth activists like me are seen as changemakers and are included in spaces like this, and that governments and companies commit to making the digital environment a safe and healthy space for us.  Here is my full statement that I delivered today: My name is Abril and I am 17 years old. I was born in Argentina, and I am a human rights defender and child participation activist. When I was invited to speak about children’s and adolescents’ rights in digital environments, I asked myself: what do we look for in a digital environment? Children and adolescents are looking for a safe, trusted space in which our rights will be respected. And I thought, well, what do we actually find? At this point I was confronted with two very unequal situations: On the one hand, there are many children who don’t even have access to digital environments, either through poverty or because of a lack of infrastructure in their countries. On the other, those of us who do have access risk suffering harmful situations such as online violence, cyberbullying, gender stereotypes in social media or the disclosure of our personal data and information. Those who create and shape technologies today do not account for the impact they have and will have on our rights in the future. What about the privacy and security of a child who fills out an online form without knowing what her data will be used for? What about the well-being of a child who receives discriminatory Instagram messages about their gender identity before going to bed? What about the mental health of a girl who looks in the mirror and compares her body to those of the challenges she sees on Tik Tok? As a young activist at Amnesty International, I know that our participation is essential in the design and regulation of digital spaces. The only way to make them safe and effective for children is if we create and define them together. Adults have an obligation to listen to our ideas and incorporate them into decision-making processes. The realities of all children must be taken into account. The time for action is NOW, not only for us but with us at the centre. We have a lot to say, and we want to be part of creating a fairer and safer digital world for everybody.

0,"Women, Protest and Power- Confronting the Taliban",AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2023/03/women-protest-and-power-confronting-the-taliban/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? As women, we managed to exercise and, to a certain extent, enjoy our human rights in Afghanistan in the past few decades. There were around two million girls in the secondary schools and thousands of female students were pursuing higher education in different fields. Women were working as doctors, teachers, pilots, athletes, actresses, politicians, diplomats, ministers, deputy ministers, directors, provincial governors, defence lawyers, judges, businesswomen, CEOs, and employees of NGOs. The Constitution of Afghanistan was one of the most progressive constitutions in the South Asia region and Afghanistan was showing progress when reporting on human rights treaties implementation before the UN treaty bodies.  The government institutions such as the Ministry of Women Affairs, Upper House and Lower House of the Parliament, Independent Human Rights Commission; as well as the Prosecution Office for Elimination of Violence against Women and the Special Courts for Elimination of Violence against Women were successful in addressing the challenges women faced in Afghanistan, to some extent. However, the return of the Taliban in Afghanistan on August 15, 2021, took away these limited yet important achievements from women and girls. Afghanistan’s collapse and the subsequent seizure of power by the Taliban is extremely painful, miserable, bitter, and destructive for people of my country, particularly, women. The restrictions placed on women’s participation in social, political, cultural, and educational fields, schools, universities, and NGOs means that once again we are imprisoned in our houses and the terrible and bitter history of 1996 is being repeated.  In addition to women’s rights, the Taliban continue to violate other human rights. Arbitrary arrests, torture, public punishment, injustice, and violence continue to be committed by the Taliban with zero accountability. Why did the world let the Universal Declaration of Human Rights be violated? The current situation and silence of the world is painful and terrible for all people, and even more for women protestors.   We have not given up despite all the adversities. We refuse to accept being jailed in our homes, we refuse to be discriminated against, we refused to be repressed! Following the Taliban’s takeover, women began peaceful protests against social and political justice and to demand their legal, social, and political rights. We protested and marched on the streets of Kabul as we called out the Taliban-  “Taliban… Taliban – the violators of human and women rights” “We don’t want your puppet regime” “You rose to power by killing dozens of people” “Your regime is illegitimate” “We want a legitimate government based on the people’s votes” We don’t want your puppet regime
 However, the Taliban brought dozens of military forces onto the streets and used violence against us. They beat us, used tear gas, fired shots in the air, gave us electric shocks, and arbitrarily detained us. The Taliban shouted at us to be silent, aimed their gun at us, threatened us with death and asked: “How much money has been given to you Western bitches for creating this riot?” We froze with fear, but I asked the protestors not to get frightened. We continued our protest by sitting on the ground. We continue to motivate the protestors to carry on with their demonstrations, carry on their fight and stand for their commitments towards protecting women’s rights. We sacrificed our lives and money to ensure consistency of protests, we did not belong to any political party in the past and we were agitated and willing to sacrifice ourselves. We protested against the closure of secondary schools for girls and chanted: “Do not politicize education”. It was the power of women to stand against the Taliban and demand their rights.    We protested on the streets, compiled reports, were interviewed by the local and international media, and wrote on social media against Taliban for months. A women protestors’ group was formed, and we continued to raise our voice for justice on the streets and the protests were leading to a people’s movement, but the Taliban got concerned because we were the only power that was fighting against them with nothing in hand. We showed the real face of the Taliban to the world, but the Taliban started to capture, arrest, imprison and torture the women protestors to repress and silence them as their strong critics. On February 9, 2022, we had to go to a shelter due to fear of being arrested by the Taliban, our only fear was rape not death. We were there to be evacuated to Qatar. Unfortunately, two days later, on February 11, 2022, hundreds of Taliban members attacked and arrested many of the protestors – women, men and children. It was a terrible night, there were so many of them, they even came with tanks and armoured vehicles, they were fully armed. They beat the men, the plea and cries of women and children spread across the aisle and the Taliban took us by force to the vehicles of the Ministry of Interior. We faced brutality during our detention, we passed difficult days. They were mentally torturing us by asking the same questions repeatedly. They asked me why I was protesting against their rule? I told them that my protest is because of girls’ education. I then asked, “which religion prohibits women from education? Do women not have the right to education?”.  They told me to be silent and threatened me with death, but I said even though I am breathing, I feel like you have already killed me. They asked me to tell them the name of the organization supporting us to hold protests. I said that I studied the book named “Street, Protest and Power” and wrote about it, I have to protest against the injustice and demand justice. I was speaking but was shaking with fear, I even peed a little. I smelled bad and I had the same experience each time they investigated me. The Taliban repeatedly named me as a spy of the National Resistance Front of Afghanistan. Eventually, we met our family members after one week and they released me on bail after 18 days after my brother gave them a guarantee. They took our house documents as guarantee that I will not stand against their authority in the future. I was released on Feb 28, 2022, and that is when I fled to Pakistan. I have been through very difficult days and visited the doctor several times and until now I have not been in good condition. Unfortunately, the condition of women protestors has not improved so far. Most of us live with an unknown future, financial problems, and in a very bad psychological condition. The programmes announced for the evacuation of the people at risk are very slow and insufficient. However, we have been displaced from our country and had to flee, we need a secure place to continue our struggle. While Afghan girls and women continue to face violence, discrimination, and intimidation, the International Community has failed to hold the Taliban accountable for violation of human rights. The International Community cannot address the injustice against women and girls in Afghanistan by the Taliban by only issuing some statements and tweets. Therefore, after 18 months, it is the time for international community through the United Nations General Assembly, UN Security Council and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to put Taliban under serious pressure for the obvious violation of human rights, social justice and imprisonment of half of the population of Afghanistan. If the International Community does not take any action soon, then they are complicit with the Taliban in the elimination of women and girls in Afghanistan.

0,Türkiye/Syria Earthquakes: A Human Rights Approach to Crisis Response,AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2023/02/turkiye-syria-earthquakes-a-human-rights-approach-to-crisis-response/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? The catastrophic earthquakes that devastated south-eastern Türkiye and northern Syria on 6 February and again on 20 February require a committed and sustained global humanitarian response. To date, the combined death toll is over 46,000 and climbing. Hundreds of thousands have been left homeless and without shelter, food, potable water, and medical care. Thousands remain missing. Amnesty International expresses its deepest sympathies to all those affected by the earthquakes and acknowledges the tireless efforts of volunteers and first responders in search and rescue operations in such difficult circumstances. Aid has been slow in coming and more than two weeks after the initial quakes, the needs of people and communities in the two countries continue to grow. Türkiye has invoked a state of emergency in the affected provinces. Aid provision in Syria has been slowed down and obstructed by political considerations and logistical difficulties that have eclipsed the need for an urgent and immediate response to people’s needs in the north-west. In responding to a major crisis, there must be concerted efforts towards the promotion and protection of the human rights of everyone. These include:     Women, children, displaced people, older people, people with disabilities, LGBTI people, ethnic and racial minorities, and other marginalized groups often face compounded challenges in crises, including natural disasters, and require special protection against discrimination and racist attacks and abuse. The provision of aid in dire situations of natural disaster must be applied without discrimination of any kind, including on the basis of nationality, ethnicity, religion, migration status, and political views. A human rights approach to disaster response can facilitate the fair and effective provision of humanitarian assistance and hold governments to account regarding their compliance with international human rights standards, including the principle of non-discrimination. States must not target in a discriminatory manner any group that is lawfully raising money and/or distributing disaster relief and must not arbitrarily confiscate such relief funds or materials. The fundamental principle of non-discrimination must be integrated into all disaster prevention, response, relief, recovery and reconstruction efforts from the earliest stages. States must respect, protect, and fulfil their human rights obligations without discrimination. Any state response must ensure that people are able to assert their rights and are not otherwise disadvantaged or subjected to reprisals based on their race, ethnicity, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, sexual orientation, marital status, property, disability, birth, age or other status. No person should be denied access to aid due to the absence or loss of identity or other documentation.  A human rights-compliant approach to natural disasters that takes into account the particular needs of at-risk groups can also prevent exposure to future human rights violations.  In Syria, the government continues to prevent or restrict aid from entering areas with populations perceived to be opposed to the government or areas outside its control. At least four million people living in north-west Syria under the control of opposition groups were already living in appalling conditions, entirely dependent on humanitarian aid due to the Syrian government’s denial and obstruction of access to aid and essential services. They had no capacity to cope with additional destruction and damage inflicted by the earthquakes. After the earthquakes, both the Syrian government and armed opposition groups restricted aid crossing from Damascus to the north-west. The Syrian government has prevented aid from reaching predominantly Kurdish neighbourhoods in areas under the control of the Kurdish civilian council in Aleppo city, which were severely impacted by the earthquake. The government also restricted and/or delayed the Autonomous Administration, the de-facto authority in north-east Syria, from delivering fuel, food and non-food items, and medical supplies to affected areas under government control and in the north-west. In northern Aleppo, armed opposition groups supported by Türkiye restricted the delivery of aid to Syrian Kurds living in the area and obstructed rescue efforts.  The immediate provision of life-saving aid in the form of personnel, machinery and operational equipment to rescue people trapped in the earthquake rubble is essential. In both Türkiye and Syria, such operational organization has been severely lacking to the point that countless deaths might have been avoided had more concerted rescue plans been triggered from the start of the crisis. The Turkish authorities called for international assistance, which was forthcoming, but the lack of coordination, personnel and equipment including heavy machinery and specialized search and rescue technology significantly hampered lifesaving intervention. Türkiye’s Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency under the aegis of the Ministry of Interior has come under fire for lack of experience and expertise. Relatives of those stuck under the rubble have taken to social media to voice their cries for help, while many reported contracting heavy equipment themselves to save lives. On 7 February, President Erdoğan acknowledged that there were problems with the state’s initial response to the earthquake. As of 15 February, only small rescue teams from Egypt and Spain were sent to assist volunteer groups in north-west Syria. Local organizations told Amnesty International that they received minimal support in terms of heavy machinery and other rescue tools that severely hampered their search and rescue efforts. However, Arab, north-African countries, Iran and others sent support to the Syrian government, which was used only in government-held areas and not in the north-west.   The first UN aid convoy to north-west Syria, travelling from Türkiye through the Bab al-Hawa border crossing — the only UN Security Council authorized border crossing – arrived three days after the earthquake. The Syrian government issued a three-month authorization for two new border crossings, Bab al Salam and al-Rai, for UN aid deliveries to northern Syria on 13 February – more than a week after the earthquakes.  Local organizations told Amnesty International that the delay in UN aid was partially attributed to the insufficient number of border crossings and coordination related challenges. The Bab al-Hawa crossing has been the only lifeline to millions in north-west Syria since July 2020 when Russia and China vetoed the reauthorization of the Bab al-Salam crossing. Türkiye, Syria and the international community must commit to faster, more efficient provision of aid, free from undue political influence and manoeuvring. UN member states should do everything in their power to ensure that the UN has sufficient access to northern Syria for as long as necessary to meet survivors’ urgent needs. Survivors of humanitarian disasters have a right to timely, relevant, accessible and accurate information in a language they understand, without discrimination. Provision of such information can prevent further loss of life. Disaster affected people and communities must also be afforded meaningful participation and consultation in any decisions/strategies for addressing their needs, including opportunities for self-help and mutual aid within and among communities. At minimum, survivors should have access to timely information regarding those who are dead or presumed to be dead; any available information about missing relatives or friends; and specific details regarding the provision of food, water, shelter, medical, reproductive health, and other essential services. The state is obligated to respect, protect, promote and fulfil the right to freedom of expression. Any restrictions on this right must be provided by law and be necessary and proportionate. In Türkiye, people trapped under the earthquake debris had been communicating via social media regarding their whereabouts in order to effect their own rescues. The Turkish government’s apparent banning of Twitter and Tik Tok on 8 February was a blow to such rescue efforts. Although access without requiring VPN (Virtual Private Network) has been restored, any such ban was neither necessary nor proportionate to meet a legitimate state objective, which should have been to facilitate lifesaving technologies, not cut them off because authorities were offended by criticism about their handling of the crisis. Media provide news and other information in the public interest and must be permitted to operate freely, especially in times of crisis when such information could be lifesaving. Media in both Türkiye and Syria are tightly controlled and journalists, including from foreign outlets, and independent media outlets have struggled to operate in both countries. In government-controlled areas in Syria, the authorities control all media and online expression, and there are no independent media outlets. In April 2022, following increasing criticism of the Syrian government’s socio-economic policies, a new cybercrime law was passed that imposed harsh sentences and fines against anyone who criticized the authorities online. The Turkish government’s response to the catastrophe led to widespread criticism, including in the media, regarding the lack of and deficiencies in rescue efforts in the hours and first days after the earthquake. On 7 February, President Erdoğan publicly threatened to target those who criticized the authorities. In the first two days following the earthquake, the state detained over 90 people, including journalists, some based solely on their social media posts. The same day, the head of media and communications at the Presidency Fahrettin Altun announced the launch of a mobile app to fight disinformation. While disinformation is a serious concern, a key way to prevent it is to ensure more media freedom.   The prohibition against arbitrary detention is absolute. As noted, in Türkiye the authorities have detained persons critical of the government’s slow response to the earthquakes.  Several people have been arbitrarily detained based on nothing more than their condemnation of the poor state response to the disaster and pleas for more help. In Syria, the government and armed opposition groups have routinely arrested or apprehended individuals simply for expressing critical opinions.  There have been reports that those criticizing the Syrian government’s aid distribution efforts and accusing the government of siphoning off aid were arrested.  People’s right to freedom of expression includes the right to criticize their government without reprisals such as arbitrary detention. The ban on torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment is absolute, allowing no exceptions, even in times of national emergency. People who have been detained for alleged looting following the earthquake in Türkiye have been subjected to torture and other ill-treatment in state custody. Videos of such abuse are under review by Amnesty International and people’s testimonies regarding their ill-treatment continue to be collected.  In Syria, torture and other ill-treatment in detention by Syria’s security forces, and to a lesser extent armed opposition groups, are prevalent and fostered by a culture of impunity. Deaths in custody: At least one person is confirmed to have died in state custody in Türkiye after being detained by the police. On 15 February, it was reported that three gendarmes have been suspended in connection with this death. Hundreds of thousands of people in Türkiye and Syria have been left without homes or other adequate shelter by the earthquakes and many have fled the devastated areas. All survivors should be able to access emergency shelter in hotels, dormitories, hostels or other accommodation reserved for earthquake victims. People in earthquake-affected areas must be permitted to leave and seek shelter and humanitarian aid in other cities. The authorities, in collaboration with humanitarian aid agencies, civil society organizations and representatives of the affected people must devise a time-bound plan for relief and recovery measures, including for moving people will be out of emergency accommodation into more permanent forms of housing. Displaced people must be supported to make voluntary and informed decisions about their future, without discrimination and irrespective of citizenship or residence status.   Any relocation of internally displaced persons from camps or disaster areas must be voluntary, unless the safety and health of those affected requires evacuation. Procedural safeguards should be put in place to ensure that any evacuations comply with international standards on evictions. After people are moved away from danger, states must ensure that terms of resettlement and conditions at all resettlement sites comply with the criteria for adequacy of housing under international human rights law.  Displaced people should not be coerced in any way, including through the suspension of assistance. All displaced persons have the right to return to their former homes unless safety issues prevent it. Where displaced persons are unable to return to their former homes because of safety concerns, the government must prepare a clear time-bound plan for the restoration/rebuilding of those areas so that they are safe for living and people can return to their former homes as soon as possible. Even before the earthquake, 2.7 million people who resided in north-west Syria were internally displaced from different parts of the country due to the conflict in the country. The majority live in tents and appalling conditions that exacerbate disease and expose women and girls to gender-based violence. After the earthquakes, the UN said that almost 60,000 people were displaced in the area.   Urgent steps should be taken to ensure that internally displaced people affected by the earthquake have equal access to relief and rehabilitation measures. In government-held areas of Syria, some neighbourhoods were evacuated and buildings demolished after damage assessment teams deemed them unsafe. It is still unclear if the government will provide all the owners of these structures with financial support or alternative housing. To date, the government announced the start of the construction of 300 prefabricated housing units in Aleppo city.  Authorities must commit to, develop, and implement a plan to either provide affected people with adequate alternative housing or rebuild housing in the area that is safe and earthquake resistant. All decisions concerning alternative housing whether in the form of resettlement or built in-situ must be taken after a process of genuine consultation with affected people. Persons requiring international protection due to their status as refugees and asylum seekers must have their rights safeguarded.   There have been credible reports from Türkiye that Syrian refugees have been targeted by both civilians and state actors for physical abuse and verbal harassment in racist attacks and/or with hate speech. Reports also indicate that Syrian refugees have been evicted from emergency camps in Türkiye to make room for Turkish survivors. The Turkish authorities must not engage in the scapegoating of refugees or tolerate such abuses by others against them. Apart from their obligation to refrain from discrimination, state authorities also have a general positive obligation to secure human rights on a non-discriminatory basis to persons and groups subject to their jurisdiction. This includes positive obligations to counter racism and discrimination by taking protective action against threats and attacks. Migrants must be treated in accordance with international human rights standards, including the International Convention for the Protection of the Rights of all Migrant Workers, to which both Türkiye and Syria are state parties. In their response to the earthquakes, Türkiye and Syria must take into consideration the general principles of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the specific risks for children’s rights. The child’s right to non-discrimination, the best interests of the child, the right to be heard and the right to life, survival and development principles remain of fundamental importance to the governments’ responses to the earthquakes. In both countries, hundreds of children have been rescued, but their parents remain missing. Many children cannot even be identified as they are too young to know their full names or home addresses. Türkiye and Syria must take all necessary measures to identify separated children at the earliest possible stage and reunify separated children with their families as a matter of urgency. When temporary alternative care is considered to be in the best interests of the child, suitable alternative care should be provided. The adoption of separated and unaccompanied children should only take place if it is considered to be in the best interests of the child and after efforts to trace and reunite a child with their family have been unsuccessful. Adoption arrangements should be avoided if the situation remains unsettled. International adoption should be a measure of last resort, used only after domestic alternatives – including rigorous efforts to locate parents, other relatives, or domestic adoptive parents — have been exhausted. Competent authorities must ensure that children are not taken out of the country without adequate safeguards in place and the completion of formal legal proceedings for international adoption With families separated, hundreds of children in Türkiye and Syria face greater risks of violations and abuses. Türkiye and Syria have an obligation to protect children from any forms of abuse and exploitation, including trafficking; child labour; contemporary forms of slavery, early and child marriage, and sexual exploitation, among others.   Turkish and Syrian state institutions must provide the capacity to determine the status of children and every effort should be made to minimize family separation in the context of rescue and disaster relief operations. Family tracing and reunification should be a priority for the international community, the Turkish and Syrian authorities and international aid agencies. The return of children to schools must be facilitated as quickly as possible. Special measures must be put in place to ensure that girls, children with disabilities and other marginalized groups have equal access to education. In post-disaster situations, women and girls are often particularly at risk of sexual violence, exploitation by traffickers and reduced access to sexual, reproductive and maternal health services and care. Their disadvantage in accessing aid is well documented. Women and girls must have access to menstrual products and healthcare that specifically addresses their medical needs. Local authorities responsible for aid distribution must not discriminate against women based on their gender or marital status.  Those involved in relief and reconstruction efforts must ensure that the prevention of all gender-based violence, particularly sexual violence, is integrated into their work. Survivors of such violence must be provided with appropriate medical and psych-social support. LGBTI people in Türkiye have endured harassment, physical assault, and other rights abuses in for many years. In the aftermath of the earthquakes, many LGBTI people have refrained from attempting to access shelter, medical care or other aid for fear of reprisals and concerns about their safety.   State authorities and civic volunteers have prioritized “traditional” families in providing transportation to access aid and services. Amnesty International is monitoring reports of physical assaults on members of the LGBTI community and access to economic and social rights, including adequate housing and access to employment. The Turkish authorities must not discriminate against LGBTI people in the provision of aid, refrain from rhetoric or other action that targets or scapegoats LGBTI people, and hold accountable any person who discriminates against, levels hate speech at or physically assaults members of the LGBTI community. Older people and people with disabilities have been recognized among the most marginalized groups during crises. There are often gaps in humanitarian response programmes affecting them, including significant barriers in equally accessing their rights and exclusion from meaningful participation and representation in decision making. Older women and women with disabilities often face compounded risks of exclusion. Relief efforts must ensure that infrastructure in displacement sites – for example, shelters, latrines, water points – is accessible for older people and people with limited mobility. Entities involved in distribution of aid, whether rations or cash-based assistance, must ensure it equally reaches older people and people with disabilities and that these efforts are not centralized.   Health services must also not be exclusively centre-based and must ensure that older people and people with disabilities have access to medication, referral and follow-up services as well as quality assistive devices and prostheses. Where older people and people with disabilities are not able to access relief and other distribution points, special measures must be put in place to ensure that relief – whether rations, cash or healthcare is delivered to them. All businesses are expected to respect human rights and should avoid engaging in any activities/operations that harm the rights of others. In this context, it is appropriate for the authorities to investigate the role that companies may have played in the disaster, for example by flouting building safety and construction rules.   In Türkiye, the Ministry of Justice announced the detention of over 100 building contractors for building code and other regulatory violations. The Ministry also announced the establishment of Earthquake Crimes Investigation bureaus “to identify contractors and others responsible for building works, gather evidence, instruct experts including architects, geologists and engineers, and check building permits and occupation permits.” However, the focus on private contractors and businesses should not detract the authorities from the state’s own responsibility and liability for poorly constructed buildings that could not withstand the force of the earthquakes due to structural deficiencies. States are obligated under international human rights law to protect against human rights abuse within their territory by third parties, including business enterprises. Authorities in Türkiye have faced criticism for the large-scale government amnesties for buildings constructed without adherence to strict building regulations. In a written reply dated December 2022 to an opposition parliamentary question from October 2022, the Minister for the Environment, Urbanization and Climate Change Murat Kurum stated that the last such amnesty was granted in 2018 with over three million building registration documents being issued.   The state is responsible for regulating the construction industry, eliminating corruption within it and holding those that violate regulations to account.  Attacks on areas in northern Aleppo and north-west Syria continue to be reported in the aftermath of the earthquakes. All parties, including the Syrian and Turkish governments, and armed opposition groups, must immediately cease attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructures, as well as all indiscriminate attacks in the region. NOTE: The human rights challenges in Türkiye and Syria set out here are based on Amnesty International’s past work on natural disasters, including the catastrophic 2010 earthquake in Haiti, and on best practice guidelines for the protection of human rights in such crisis situations.

0,"Truth, Justice, Reparations: Spain and Morocco must provide answers to victims of human rights violations in Melilla",AI Hungary,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2022/12/truth-justice-reparations-spain-and-morocco-must-provide-answers-to-victims-of-human-rights-violations-in-melilla/,,"Which language would you like to use this site in? Spain and Morocco must provide answers to victims of human rights violations in Melilla Zacharias, a 22-year-old man, had fled his home country of Chad and traveled through eight countries, asking for asylum in several of them, but in none of them did he receive protection. 24 June was the first time he tried to enter Spain, “I am shocked by what I have seen. I thought Europe was something else, something different.” Zacharias was beaten by Moroccan and Spanish police officers on that day and was caught by Spanish police as he climbed down from the fence on the Melilla side of the border. On 24 June 2022, the deadliest incident ever recorded at the Melilla border between Morocco and Spain left at least 37 people dead and 76 more missing. These people, who came from sub-Saharan Africa seeking safety, were met with prolonged and excessive use of force by Moroccan and Spanish security officials and many were left lying injured on the floor inside a fenced-off enclosure for hours. A report by Amnesty International details how this violence, along with a failure to provide timely medical assistance, contributed to – if not directly caused – their deaths and injuries. 6 months later, neither Morocco nor Spain have conducted independent and impartial investigations, and no one has been brought to justice for these grave human rights violations. This is not only an insult to the memory of those who died, but also exacerbates the suffering of their loved ones and other victims, who need truth, justice and reparations for these crimes. The 24 June tragedy epitomizes the failure of European migration policies and the approach to border management by Morocco and Spain, where the focus has for decades been on security, rather than ensuring a safe and humane treatment to migrants and asylum seekers. This catastrophic incident illustrates discrimination and disregard for people’s lives, both by the policy makers and those carrying out their orders at the borders. 
 They throw stones at you, they hit you with sticks and they also use sharp objects. When you are at the top, they hit you with stones and sticks to make you fall in. If you fall, you can drown. Sometimes the Moroccan police even push us into the boat. There are people who disappear; they are never heard from again Melilla, one of the two Spanish enclaves in Morocco, shares a physical land border of 11.2 km with Morocco and is separated from the Northern province of Nador by three fences. These fences, and particularly the four official border crossing points along it, have been the sites of deaths and injuries of many people trying to leave Morocco and enter Europe. Melilla is a fortified zone, with fences, concrete walls, ditches and barbed wire fences, all designed to prevent people from accessing Spanish territory. Amnesty International has long documented how the militarization and securitisation of these border management systems, as well as the use of weapons to stop people from crossing the Ceuta and Melilla borders, makes it difficult for people to access safe routes for asylum. “…the violence documented in videos of the scenes at Melilla’s gate tragically reveals the status quo of the European Union’s borders, namely racialised exclusion and deadly violence deployed to keep out people of African and Middle Eastern descent, and other non-white populations, irrespective of their rights under international refugee or international human rights law. On the morning of that fateful day, between 1500 and 2000 refugees and migrants, mostly Sudanese, attempted to cross the border between Morocco and Melilla.As they approached the informal crossing point of Barrio Chino, they were met by more than 100 Moroccan border forces firing at them with tear gas, pelting rocks and hitting them with batons. The force of their response, which lasted more than two hours, resulted in at least 37 people dying and many more being injured. Some 76 people are still missing to this day.Moroccan and Spanish security forces used weapons such as batons, tear gas and rubber bullets in an enclosed area from which people could not easily leave. Law enforcement officials continued to use such weapons even after people were under police control and could not move. Testimonies indicate that actions by both Spanish and Moroccan police and border guards used unlawful force and were punitive in intent. People have described to Amnesty International how border guards beat them, repeatedly used tear gas in confined spaces and denied them access to healthcare, even when they were badly injured.“We realized that we were in a box, both the Moroccan and Spanish security forces were throwing everything at us, gas bombs, stones, rubber bullets, rubber balls… We couldn’t see anything, and it was difficult to breathe.” Zacharias, 22, from Chad “The police used tools; stones, knives, sticks, and they shot us with small guns with rubber bullets. They hit us on our heads with long wooden sticks and knives.” As the Moroccan border forces began throwing tear gas and stones at the group,  eyewitnesses stated that two stampedes formed as people tried desperately to escape the attack.Witnesses said that Moroccan agents then started to beat people using batons, kicking them and throwing stones, including at those already on the ground and injured.  Those who continued to climb the fences were specifically targeted by the border forces pelting them with stones and beating them with batons on their backs and feet. This caused many people to fall, after which they were herded, using baton charges, into a concentrated area.Around 400 people were trapped in this 200m2 enclosed area between the walls and the Moroccan forces. At that point, Moroccan police officers threw people on top of each other, whether alive, injured or dead. This can be seen in several videos verified by Amnesty International, which show people lying on the ground while Moroccan officers poke and hit them with their batons. In one video, a Moroccan officer is clearly seen kicking a person lying on the ground. “The police used tools; stones, knives, sticks, and they shot us with small guns with rubber bullets. They hit us on our heads with long wooden sticks and knives.”Abuobida, a 25-year-old Sudanese manAbdessalam, a man in his early twenties from Sudan, said that he climbed over the first wall before it fell but that Moroccan officials caught him and took him back. He described watching the Moroccan police beating his brother and cousin to death as he was climbing over the wall.“They were trying to climb the wall, but the authorities had tear gas and stones. They [his brother and cousin] fell down on the Moroccan side and the police were hitting them with wooden sticks. They died because of the beating.” Meanwhile, the Spanish police forces arrived at the fences at Barrio Chino crossing point from the Spanish side, preventing people from entering Melilla.Amnesty International condemns the Spanish security forces in Melilla’s unlawful use of force, including at times with punitive intent or effect, and misused weapons including rubber balls, smoke canisters and tear gas. What was particularly shocking was the use of pepper spray and tear gas at close distance to prevent people from entering Melilla, even while they were trapped inside the border enclosure and being attacked from all sides by Moroccan and Spanish forces over a two hour period, where it was clear that the gas would affect people who could not escape.Amnesty International was told that Spanish security forces continued to beat people even after they were in their control and unable to respond, including as they handed individuals over to the Moroccan forces.Zacharias, a 22-year-old man from Chad, said that he was caught by Spanish police after he came down from the fence.“An officer hit me on the head with a truncheon. My face was covered in blood. He tied my hands behind my back, lifted me by my shirt and passed me between the fences where a Moroccan policeman was waiting.”I could see how Moroccan police officers beat people who were on the ground unconscious…I got away from him and started to run through the area between the fences…I asked for asylum in several African countries, but in none of them did I get protection. The 24th [of June] was the first time I tried to enter Spain. I am shocked by what I have seen. I thought Europe was something else, something different.”   Moroccan and Spanish officers inflicted widespread beatings on injured people trapped in between the fences of the Barrio Chino border crossing.The crush left people piled on top of each other, some of them already dead, and was intensified as officials violently pushed more people on top of those already lying on the ground. This violent repression lasted over two hours.Even more disturbingly, for at least 8 hours afterwards neither Moroccan nor Spanish officers provided adequate medical assistance to the wounded people – a display of inhumanity which likely contributed to avoidable loss of life.The Moroccan authorities did not send ambulances to the scene until 11:30am, around two and a half hours after the border crossing attempt began. The four ambulances that Morocco did send initially prioritised removing dead bodies rather than helping the injured people.Later, some more ambulances arrived, allowing more injured people to be transferred. The last ambulance left the scene at 9pm, 12 hours after it all began. Between 11.30am and 9pm, minimal and grossly inadequate medical assistance was provided to injured people at the scene, according to testimonies received by Amnesty International.On the Spanish side of the border, the authorities also failed to make any effort to provide much-needed medical assistance to wounded people crammed into the facility. What is more, a testimony by Isam, a young man from Sudan, described Spanish authorities forcibly removing people from Spanish territory and transferring them to Moroccan security forces, without any sign of due process to assess safety risks, and despite them being in evident need of medical care, a dereliction of duty that may amount to torture and other ill-treatment. Moreover, it may even have contributed to a number of deaths Months later, families of 76 people who have been missing since that day are still searching for answers.The Moroccan Ministries of Justice and the Interior have so far done nothing to help them discover the fate and whereabouts of their loved ones and have in fact obstructed attempts by families and NGOs to locate them.All of these individuals were last seen in the custody of state officials, either put on buses to be transferred to cities across Morocco, or otherwise being restrained at the border.Kori, a 17-year-old Sudanese boy, lost many friends on 24 June. He said that he along with “all of the people captured by the police were taken by the Moroccan police to the prison, then after that in the prison they were being beaten by hammers in their head until they passed away.”According to his testimony, some policemen shot people in the head directly with rubber bullets while in prison. After a few days, he said, the police “started removing people and taking them to the Algerian desert, about 200km from the city. Those who were badly injured were taken to hospital and others were distributed within cities in Morocco.” The Moroccan authorities have refused to publish the list of those who died that day and to actively inform their families, and have made it practically impossible for other organizations such as the AMDH and ICRC to carry out their work in searching for missing people.The day after the attempted border crossing, the AMDH were able to access the Nador morgue, for the first and only time and found 15 bodies of people who appeared to have suffered injuries to their heads and faces, chest and feet. After publishing this information, they were denied permission to look at the bodies or to verify their identities.   I saw [my uncle] in a video laying on the ground and he looked dead… I have an uncle who lives in France who went to Spain to verify the news of the passing of Anwar, but the authorities in Spain didn’t allow him to do anything The victims and their families deserve the truth, justice and reparations for the catalogue of human rights abuses committed on 24 June 2022 at Melilla.There is compelling evidence that Moroccan and Spanish security forces used unnecessary and excessive force, committed acts which may amount to torture and other ill-treatment – including beatings even after people were restrained, and denied medical care to people injured by state officials, which in addition to causing pain and suffering, likely contributed to the at least 37 people dying, and many others being injuredThey also failed to ensure that people’s right to seek asylum was respected, instead committing refoulement by forcing people back into the hands of Moroccan officials where they were at real risk of serious human rights violations.Many people were forcibly transferred away from the border crossing, and many have been subjected to enforced disappearance, as their fate and whereabouts continues to be unknown.Despite the evidence of such grave human rights violations, neither the Spanish not the Moroccan authorities have launched independent and impartial investigations, and no one has been held accountable.Indeed, the authorities have continued to violate the right to information, truth and justice for the families and friends of at least 76 individuals who have not seen or heard from their loved ones since they were last seen in the hands of Moroccan forces that day.   
 Spanish authorities have asserted that there are safe and legal routes to claim asylum available, but this claim has been shown to be unfounded at Melilla.At this border on 24 June,  people were subjected to deadly violence, which may amount to torture and other ill-treatment, refoulement, forcible transfer, enforced disappearances, amongst other egregious human rights violations, all at the hands of Moroccan and Spanish border guards. Disturbingly, the relatives of those killed are being impeded rather than supported in the search for their loved ones.  Six months on and we do not even know precisely how many people died that day, and r the fate and whereabouts of at least 76 people is still unknown.The failure to conduct impartial investigations into what happened that day not only breaches human rights obligations, but also shows a complete disregard for the victims and their families, and leaves open the possibility that such abuses could be committed again in future.

Since 2018, Indian authorities have arrested 16 activists under a draconian anti-terror law Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) in connection with the Bhima Koregaon-Elgar Parishad case. 9 of them continue to languish in prison without trial. The repression of activists must end.  The BK16 activists include poets, journalists, lawyers, professors, artists, and a Jesuit priest, who have been charged under various provisions of the Indian Penal Code and draconian Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), which has been abused to detain people for peacefully exercising their rights to freedom of expression, assembly, and association.    These HRDs have long worked to defend the rights of some of India’s poorest and most marginalized communities, including Dalits and Adivasis – India’s indigenous peoples. They are India’s heroes.  One of the 16 activists, Fr. Stan Swamy died in detention due to denial of timely medical treatment.
